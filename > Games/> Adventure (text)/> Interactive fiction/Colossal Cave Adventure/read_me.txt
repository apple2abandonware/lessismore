Colossal Cave Adventure (also known as ADVENT, Colossal Cave, or Adventure) is a text 
adventure game, developed originally in 1976, by Will Crowther for the PDP-10 mainframe. 
The game was expanded upon in 1977, with help from Don Woods, and other programmers 
created variations on the game and ports to other systems in the following years.

Colossal Cave Adventure is the first known work of interactive fiction and, as the first
text adventure game, is considered the precursor for the adventure game genre.
