Dropping out of hyperspace, you lay a course for Lagrange Station.
Suddenly, the klaxon screams out a warning.  Two Darts and a Corsair,
closing fast.  Pirates!

You roll hard to avoid the incoming plasma torps.  One hits, knocking
down your rear shield.  Spinning to protect your stern, you launch a
heat seeker.  Direct hit: the corsair bursts into shards.  Stunned,
the Darts run for deep space.

Later, over a pint of Rigelian in the Lagrange cantina, you listen as
a bounty hunter tells of the Scarlet Brotherhood, the most notorious
band of pirates in the Far Arm.  You hope it wasn't one of their
Corsairs you vaporized out there...

This version of SpaceRogue images has the "code wheel" protection
removed and some documentation added.  Enjoy.

			 -- Why I did this --

The other disk images of SpaceRogue require you to have the manual to
get around the "code wheel" protection.  With this version, you enter
any text, press return, and you're in.

	In the '80's we were called software pirates.  Now the
	politically correct term is "software preservationists."
