Introduction

What is Blazzing Paddles? 

BLAZING PADDLES is a very powerful and easy to use drawing program. It
allows you to use almost any input device to create drawing, diagrams,
and  text. It is easy enough for young children to use like a coloring
book, yet sophisticated features are included for the serious computer
artist. 




Equipment requirements

1. An Apple //c, //e, //+, //, or compatible computer with 48K minimum
and Applesoft. 

2. One or two disk drive. 

3. A color monitor or TV is preferred, but a monochrome  monitor  will
work fine. 

4. One of the following input device (properly connected):

 1) Mouse
 2) Graphics Tablet
 3) Touchpad (KoadlaPad or equivalent)
 4) Joystick, trackball, or similiar paddle port device
 5) Light Pen

5.  A printer is optional. You can get a printout of your picture with
most types of printers. 




 Getting Started

Before running the program, make sure your input  device  is  properly
connected.  Carefully follow the installation directions supplied with
the device. Make sure the power is OFF before connecting  anything  to
your  computer.  Next place the BLAZING PADDLES disk in drive 1 (label
facing up), and turn the computer on. When the drive  stops  spinning,
you  will  see  the  following display on your monitor screen.  At the
bottom of the screen is a menu of the various input devices.  The left
and right arrow keys are used to make a choice from this  menu.  Press
the right arrow [-=>] key to highlight the next selection on the menu.
Press the left arrow [<=-] key to move backward through the menu. When
the  device  you  are  using is highlighted, press [RETURN] to run the
program.  The disk will run for a few moments and then the  main  menu
will appear. Since each input device is operated differently, you will
have to learn the following techniques for your device. 

* How to move the "cursor" around the screen. 

* How to draw and select menu items using the "ACTION BUTTON."

* How to delete actions using the "UNDO BUTTON."



*Note  -  Light  pens  require  special techniques. If you are using a
light pen, refer to the chapter on LIGHT PENS. 


Moving the Cursor

The cursor is a small flashing marker that indicates your position  on
the screen. 

*MOUSE  -  Move mouse to position cursor on the screen.  Cursor can be
moved off the screen by moving the mouse until the cursor disappears. 

*TOUCHPAD - Places styles or finger on the pad to position  cursor  on
the screen.  Lift styles off pad to take cursor off the screen. 

*GRAPHICS  TABLET  - The "screen" area is the lower 2/3 of the tablet.
Touch the pen lightly on the surface of  the  tablet  to  positon  the
cursor on the screen. Place the pen near the top of the tablet to move
cursor off the screen. 

*JOYSTICK - Joystick and other paddles port devices.  Move joystick to
position  cursor. Move to the upper left corner to move cursor off the
screen. 


Action Button

The ACTION BUTTON is used when you want to make a  menu  selection  or
draw something on the picture. 

*MOUSE - The mouse button is the ACTION BUTTON. 

*TOUCHPAD  - There are two buttons on the touchpad. The left button is
the ACTION BUTTON. 

*GRAPHICS TABLET - The ACTION BUTTON is the point of  the  pen.   When
you press down on the pen so that the point retracts, you activate the
ACTION BUTTON. 

 *JOYSTICK  - Joystick or paddles port device - There are two buttons.
The left button (or button 0) is  normally  the  ACTION  BUTTON.  Some
joysticks may have a different layout so you may have to experiment to
find out which button to press. 


Undo Button

The UNDO BUTTON is used to remove the last item plaved on the picture.
This  allows you to try things out before they become a permanent part
of the picture. The [ESC] key on the keyboard is  used  for  the  UNDO
BUTTON.  If  you  are  using  a  device  with  two  buttons (touchpad,
joystick, etc.), the second button becomes the UNDO BUTTON. 



 *NOTE - The "undo" feature will work only  on  the  very  last  thing
drawn on the screen.
