The original version of Taipan was programmed by Art Canfil in 1979
using a TRS-80. However, the better-known commercial release was
published by Avalanche Productions and ran on the Apple ][.

Trivia buffs will note that the Apple port was coded by Ronald J. Berg
of Mega-micro Computers, a hidden snippet that's revealed by reading the
data value of memory location USR(34).

Art Canfil co-authored a book that gives not only the TRS-80 code but
also some excellent background information. The illustrations were done
by Chrisann Brennan, former girlfriend of Steve Jobs, and mother of
Jobs' daughter Lisa â€” the namesake of the forerunner of the Macintosh.

Art Canfil relates: "A few months after it [Avalanche's version of
Taipan] came out, I was invited to the founding party for Electronic
Arts. This was held in the Stanford Court Hotel in San Francisco. While
there, I saw and shook hands with and introduced myself to Steve
Wozniak, one of the main original investors in EA. He's long been one of
my heroes. He didn't know who I was. But apparently someone told him,
for a few minutes later he came running up and shook MY hand and said,
"'Taipan's my favorite game!' One of the highpoints of my life."

Unfortunately, Art never made a cent from the Avalanche release.
