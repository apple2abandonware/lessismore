Enchanter was the first fantasy game published by Infocom after the Zork
trilogy, and was originally intended to be Zork IV.

In the game Zork III, a device slowly cycles through "scenes" from each
of the Zork games as a number is displayed above it. A depiction of the
sacrificial altar from the then-unreleased Enchanter appeared under the
number "IV". Creators Dave Lebling and Marc Blank decided during the
game's design that the magic system made it a standalone product.
Regardless, Enchanter is still considered to be part of the Zork
universe.

Enchanter is the only game in the Zork universe where lurking grues,
although they still exist, are not mentioned by name; the game doesn't
even know the word "grue".
