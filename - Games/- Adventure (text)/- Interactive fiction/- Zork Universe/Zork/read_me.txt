Zork is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, with
roots drawn from the original genre game Colossal Cave Adventure. The
first version of Zork was written between 1977 and 1979 using the MDL
programming language on a DEC PDP-10 computer. The authors—Tim Anderson,
Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT
Dynamic Modelling Group.

When Zork was published commercially, it was split up into three games:
Zork: The Great Underground Empire – Part I (later known as Zork I),
Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz, and Zork III: The Dungeon Master.

Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game, in
terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of
its text parser.
