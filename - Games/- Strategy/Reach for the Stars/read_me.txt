Reach for the Stars is a science fiction strategy that is the earliest
known commercially published example of the 4X games (Explore, Expand,
Exploit, Exterminate) genre. It was written by Roger Keating and Ian
Trout of SSG of Australia and published in 1983 for the Commodore 64 and
then the Apple II in 1985.

Reach for the Stars was very strongly influenced by the Avalon Hill
board game Stellar Conquest. Many of RFTS's features have direct
correspondence in Stellar Conquest.
