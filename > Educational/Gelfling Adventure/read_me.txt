This is the same game as "The Dark Crystal", but modified to be more
playable for younger children. The parser of that game is replaced here
by a simple menu of three choices at any given time, making this version
more resemble a Choose Your Own Adventure book. The language has also
been simplified and softened; room descriptions are simpler and never
overflow the screen and references to death and darker material are
replaced with people "disappearing" or "going to sleep."
