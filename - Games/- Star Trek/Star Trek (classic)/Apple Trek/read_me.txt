Star Trek is a text-based strategy video game based on the Star Trek
television series and originally developed by Mike Mayfield in 1971.
Mayfield originally wrote the game in the BASIC programming language at
the end of high school for a SDS Sigma 7 mainframe computer with the
goal of creating a game like Spacewar! (1962) that could be played with
a teleprinter.

Mayfield rewrote Star Trek for the HP 2000C minicomputer in 1972, and it
was included in Hewlett-Packard's public domain software catalog the
following year. It was picked up from there by David H. Ahl, who ported
it with Mary Cole to BASIC-PLUS and published the source code first in
the Digital Equipment Corporation Edu newsletter and then along with
other early mainframe games and computer games in his best-selling 101
BASIC Computer Games book.

Bob Leedom then expanded the game in 1974 into Super Star Trek, which
was later printed by Ahl in BASIC Computer Games, the first
million-selling computer book. Star Trek, especially the Super Star Trek
version, was immensely popular for the era. This, along with the
availability of the source code, led to numerous ports of both versions
of the game for mainframe and microcomputers. Additionally, dozens of
variants and expansions were made for a variety of systems.

Apple Inc. released a version for the Apple II+ called Apple Trek in
1979.
