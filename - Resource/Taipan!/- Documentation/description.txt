Description

Loosely based on Clavell's Taipan, this game is a trading simulation set in the Far East 
during the 1800s. The player is based out of Hong Kong and has a single trading ship with 
which he can transport one of four cargoes from place to place. There are different 
cargoes to be traded, from the cheaper general goods to the more expensive arms and silks,
culminating in the opportunity to trade in the illegal opium trade.

Generally, the strategy here was buy low, sell high. To add some tension to the game, 
there is a random chance that you will encounter several obstacles to your trading 
empire. Random pirates, pickpockets, and thieves who rob you and your warehouse are all 
out there for their own benefit (and your detriment!) Li Yuen acts as the local mafia
boss, extorting increasing sums of money for his "protection". Local authorities will 
seize your opium and fine you if you're caught, ruining an otherwise successful voyage. 
Local market conditions can render a price extremely high or low, giving you a chance to 
make a quick buck.

You have the option to trade up to a larger ship as time goes buy, as well as outfit your
current ship with guns. However, beware! The larger the ship, the more pirate ships it
attracts! Also, the larger ships are more expensive to repair. 

You can play as long as you want--you're given the opportunity to retire once you reach
one million. You're given a score at the end of the game based on your net worth, your
ship size, and a few other factors.
