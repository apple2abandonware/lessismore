0. Generally Important Stuff

        0.1 README IF YOU HAVEN'T YET (It's not too long :)

                First, this is an FAQ.  The style is to provide hints
                to solutions for common problems people face playing
                the game.  As opposed to the walk-throughs floating
                around the 'Net, this FAQ does not do all the
                thinking for you, nor if used properly will it spoil
                the plot development!

                Earlier versions of this FAQ were criticized for
                giving away too much info to newbies and ruining the
                surprise of the game.  So in this version the FAQ is
                split into 4 parts: newbie stuff, early stuff, Vegas
                stuff, and Post-Vegas stuff.  It is recommended that
                if you have not solved the game yet, only read the
                parts up to where you have played.

                I have tried to place the information in the order
                most people will encounter it.  The programmers left
                the game fairly open so the order in which tasks are
                solved is not carved in stone.  People may disagree
                with my ordering of events, but frankly I don't care.

                I recommend only looking at the equipment/skills
                sections if you find something that you cannot
                identify correctly.  Otherwise it might give away
                some secrets.

                Feel free to read the "Hints" sections BEFORE you
                enter the areas.  They give nothing away, but do
                point you in the correct direction to start.

                In the Q&A sections, only read the answers to
                questions that you currently need help solving.  To
                do otherwise would spoil the game.

                If you have already solved the game, go wild and read
                every letter we typed.  You're likely to find
                something new.

                The masculine pronoun is used throughout
                this document.  As gender is a moot point in the game
                (except for the restrooms in Scott's Bar), no
                exclusivity is implied.

                Also note that this FAQ is specifically targeted
                toward the APPLE // version of Wasteland.  Most of
                the FAQ should be accurate for other versions, but
                this is not guaranteed.

                I'd like responses from users of other versions so as
                to make this FAQ completely comprehensive.

        0.2 Updating this FAQ

                Unless some important new information surfaces, this
                will likely be the FINAL release of this FAQ.

                If you do happen to have some important new
                information send any comments/questions/answers
                /complaints to the following e-mail addresses:

                        Stephen Sedmak <sedmaks@odo.msoe.edu>
                        Chris Baer <chbaer@cris.com>

                Please be *specific*.

        0.3 Disk Usage problems

            0.3.1 Saving Progress

                Wasteland modifies ALL of the disks.  You need to
                keep backup copies of the original.  Whenever you
                exit an area, Wasteland saves EVERYTHING you modified
                since you entered.

                *Some emulators (such as STM for the Mac) force you
                to manually save the changes to disks, so when
                leaving an area which you have cleared or finished,
                be certain to save the changes, else you might have
                to do it all over again.

            0.3.2 Apple // version will not boot

		You must boot with Wastboot.dsk.  Wastmst1.dsk is the
		first scenario disk.  It will not boot

            0.3.3 I/O error on Apple // version of Wasteland

                Many people using the Apple // version of Wasteland
                experience an I/O error when they attempt to run it.
                There is a very minor flaw in the disk images that
                causes the program to crash if you do not continue
                your last saved game.  To circumvent this problem
                when you are asked to continue the last saved game
                always answer "YES".  The original images are saved
                at the beginning of the game, so you start in the
                same place anyway.

           0.3.4 Disk Copying

                Screw the Utilities menu and just just use the
                typical software you use to copy the disks.

                The only exception would be if you have the original
                master floppies, then use Utilities to make a set of
                scenario disks.  THEN you can use your normal copy
                software to duplicate the scenario disks.  Much
                faster and easier.  Plus you can make backups :)

            0.3.5 IMPORTANT WARNING - you can damage the disks
                                      and forever lose your party!

                If you have the emulator change the disk before the
                drive in use light goes off you WILL damage the
                image.  This makes one or more maps on that disk
                image invalid.  When you enter that map the game will
                not only crash, but as soon as you enter you will be
                saved on that map.  When you reboot and try again you
                will be in the same location

                In other words, your party has been irrevocably
                destroyed.  There is no hope -- it's the end of the
                road for your party.

                The *only* solution is to have a recent backup of
                your Wasteland disk 1, or a recent saved memory
                image (very easy and fast with ApplePC).

                I don't think this will be a problem with STM because
                it doesn't automatically save to the disk.  But users
                of other emulators should beware.

                Keeping a backup of your party is no big deal.  I did
                it all the time with RPGs on my Apple //c.



        1.0 Instructions

*********************************************************************
                Would someone with a scanner PLEASE scan the
                instruction manual and post it?  It's kinda fun
                to read.  The programming crew did a good job on it.
*********************************************************************

                If you're using the cracked Apple // version, then
                the only valid thing to do is to select "Start"
                "Resume Last Saved Game - Yes".  If you've got
                an emulator it would be useful to save the booted
                state at this point.  Then whenever you want to
                reboot Wasteland, just load the state and put your
                scenario disk 1 in drive 1.

           1.0.1 Ranger Center

                The following passage taken from the instruction manual:

                "Wasteland is a post-nuclear holocaust adventure.
                Your party, the famed Desert Rangers, have been
                assigned to investigate a series of disturbances in
                the desert.  After several strategy meetings, you've
                decided to search for clues in Highpool, the
                Agricultural Center, and the Rail Nomads' Camp, all
                of which are located to the West  of Ranger Center."

                You start out in the "Ranger Center", Wasteland's
                equivalent of the Adventurer's Guild or Inn.

                The Ranger Center used to be a prison, but after the
                war all the criminals were kicked out to fend for
                themselves in the desert.  The Desert Rangers
                converted the prison into their headquarters.

                The party can have a maximum of 7 character, 4 of
                which you can create.  The other 3 are typically
                hired Non-Player-Characters (NPCs).  If you create
                less than 4 characters (not recommended) you can have
                even more NPCs in your party.

                The game starts with 4 pre-made characters, who are
                fair.  They're not horrid, but they're not great
                either.  You can probably make better ones yourself.

                See sections 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 to find out about
                Attributes, Equipment, and Skills respectively.

                Examine them by pressing the number keys 1, 2, 3,
                and 4.  Press <space> to see the next page.  Press
                <ESC> to see the previous page.  'P' Pools the money
                and 'D' divides the selected characters money over
                the entire party.

                Use the arrow keys and <ENTER> to Create a new
                character, Delete old ones, or Exit.

           1.0.2 Command Summary

                Most of the commands available are displayed
                on-screen, but if you want to find the others check
                out below.

                There's a few <CTRL> commands most people wouldn't
                figure out on their own, but they're not needed to
                play the game.

                The clock is in the upper-right hand corner.
                Military time of course.

                Note: Each map varies in time and scale.

                Non-Combat

                        <ESC> - pass time
                        I - North
                        J - West
                        K - South
                        L - East
                        <space> - Display party roster.
                        1 through 7 - Display Stats of that character
                        U - Use and Item, Attribute, or Skill
                        E - Encounter, enter Combat mode.  Useful for
                                reloading your party after a big
                                fight.
                        O - Select a new marching order
                        D - Disband - Breaks the party up into 2+
                                groups (Maximum 4).  Also lets you
                                bury the dead and kick out unwanted
                                NPCs.

                                Don't forget about it -- you NEED to
                                use it on a few occasions.
                        V - View switches the view between parties
                        S - Save the game.  You can do it in ANY
                                non-combat situation as long as you
                                have control.
                        R - Radio.  Gives you promotions (raises
                                experience level) if you have enough
                                experience.
                        <shift>-# - Shortcut for Use character number
                        <CTRL>-S - Uses the first skill for the first
                                character in your party.  Useful for
                                Perception, Picklock, or Climb.
                        <CTRL>-R - Re-orders a characters skills or
                                possessions.  Helpful in combination
                                with changing the marching order to
                                have <CTRL>-S do a specific thing.

                   Note: You can also select actions with the arrow
                        keys and <ENTER>

                Combat

                        <ESC> - Undo
                        R - Run.  Lets the whole party or a single
                                character move during combat.  Can
                                be used to flee by running around
                                corners, or to enter melee combat.
                                VERY useful!

                                Note: Run Single is the same as
                                   non-combat Disband.

                                Note: Keep in mind that when you
                                   attempt to run your running speed
                                   is determined by the Slowest speed
                                   in the party you want to move,
                                   discounting unconscious members.
                        U - Use. Works EXACTLY the same as it does in
                                non-combat situations.  Mainly useful
                                for healing during combat.
                        H - Hire an NPC.  NPCs typically will not
                                attack unless you attack them, but
                                sometimes they will be included
                                in an Encounter when true enemies
                                are involved.  Be careful not to
                                kill NPCs.

                                Note: There are several humans
                                        in the game which will not
                                        attack you, but only a few of
                                        them are actually NPCs.  The
                                        rest are usually Civilians or
                                        Guards.
                        E - Evade.  Attempts to avoid enemy attacks.
                                Can also be used as a "do nothing".
                        A - Attack.  The most basic element of combat
                                Enemies frequently come in separate
                                groups and you must select which
                                group to attack.  There are also
                                several basic types of weapons:

                                Single - Only attacks 1 thing
                                Group - Explosives hurts everyone in
                                        a group
                                Brawling - This skill gives you
                                        multiple melee attacks.  If
                                        you kill the original target
                                        remaining attacks will harm
                                        enemies remaining in the same
                                        group.
                                Burst - Fires exactly 3 shots at the
                                        group.
                                Auto - Empties the remainder of the
                                        clip.  Requires at least 4
                                        ammo.
                           Note: If you have melee weapons equipped
                                you will not be able to attack
                                enemies more than 14' away, but they
                                can still attack you if they've got
                                guns.  Either Run at them or ready
                                some ranged weapons.
                        W - Weapon select.  Selects armor too.
                                Selecting the weapon/armor you
                                currently have equipped will ready
                                FISTS/no armor.
                        L - Load or unjam weapon.  When ammo reaches
                                0 the weapon becomes a melee weapon.
                                Damage is determined by your skill
                                using the particular weapon equipped
                                -- NOT pugilism!  Brawling still
                                works no matter what melee weapon is
                                used.
                        <CTRL>-A - Shows a list of enemy groups; only
                                works if the enemies are in range and
                                you're not using an NPC.
                        Up Arrow or <CTRL>-K - Increases message
                                scroll speed.

                                scroll speed.
                           Note: Default is full speed, so you might
                                want to drag it down a few notches.

                Viewing Characters

                        1 through 7 - Displays the Status of that

        1.1 Attributes

           1.1.1 Attribute Descriptions

                Strength (ST) - Lets you break down doors and force
                        objects.  Adds roughly 1 damage to melee
                        attacks per 2 ST.  It doesn't make too much
                        of a difference.  Better to spend your points
                        on Luck or Agility if you want a melee
                        warrior.


                Intelligence (IQ) - Without doubt the most important
                        skill in the game.  It gives you skill points
                        to learn new skills and gives you a wider
                        selection of skills to select.

                Luck (LK) - Influences every part of the game where a
                        random number is involved.  Combat, traps,
                        using skills, etc...  Second only to IQ in
                        importance!  It does all the following:
                        improves accuracy, makes you harder to hurt,
                        and even causes a significant increase in
                        damage inflicted.

                Speed (SP) - Determines the order you act in combat.
                        The sooner you act the less time enemies have
                        to react.

                        Becomes sort of useless when guns are
                        involved -- everyone shoots at the same time.
                        It does help you run during combat.

                Agility (AGL) - How quick you move (could have
                        combined speed with this, but they didn't).
                        Influences likelihood of hitting in melee.
                        Also determines whether you'll be injured or
                        not in all situations.  It's devastating
                        to have a low Agility, but once you get
                        it up to 15 there's not too much benefit
                        in going any higher.  20 tops.  Concentrate
                        on Luck instead.

                Dexterity (DEX) - How steady your aim with ranged
                        weapons is.  3rd most important attribute
                        just behind Luck.  When using Autofire
                        a high DEX/Luck combination, almost every
                        shot will hit.  Needless to say, this can
                        inflict a TREMENDOUS amount of damage!

                        Note: With typical characters only 4 or 5
                                shots actually hit when burning a
                                35 shot clip!

		Charisma (CHR) - How personable you are.  Pretty
                        useless.  The only symptoms of low charisma
                        are NPCs who don't want to trade items or
                        use things all the time.  Just keep trying
                        until you succeed.  Attribute points are too
			important to waste here.

                Skill Points (SKP) - Determines how many skills you
                        can learn.  When you Radio to go up levels
                        increasing IQ gives you the same number of
                        Skill Points.  Use skill points in libraries.
                        Caution:  no 2 libraries carry all the same
                        skills.  If you want a skill and have enough
                        IQ you still won't be offered it if the
                        Library doesn't carry the books.  The library
                        in North-West Needles carries basic skills.

                Rank - Just a fancy indicator of experience level.

                MAXCON / CON - Your hit maximum and current hit
                        points.  You heal over time.  Time passes
                        fastest on the main land map.  Unconscious
                        and worse off characters usually cannot be
                        hit during combat.  Traps can still mess
                        them up.

                        If your CON is still a number but highlighted
                        in white, then your character is diseased and
                        will not heal.  In the sewers the whole party
                        is diseased.  If they all go unconscious,
                        your party is dead.  Only hospitals can heal
                        diseases.

                        UNC - Unconscious.  Give him time and he'll
                                recover.
                        SER - Serious.  He needs a medic, if not
                                he'll deteriorate.
                        CRT - Critical.  This is about the limit
                                Medic will work on.
                        MRT - Mortally wounded.  He needs help!
                        COM - Comatose.  This character will die
                                soon.

                                If you have no doctor make sure you
                                find a nice grave site.

                        skull symbol - Dead.  This ain't Bard's Tale.
                                There's no magic, no resurrect.  Dead
                                is dead.  Disband the character.

                AC (Armor Class) - Indicator of how much damage the
                        character's armor will absorb when hit.
                        A 1 is infinitely better than a 0.

                Sex - Only affects what bathrooms you can go in.

                Nationality - affects nothing.

                $ - The amount of cash he's toting.

           1.1.2 Attribute Hints

                At the start of the game spend almost all points on
                raising IQ until you hit about 28.

                Important attributes are: Luck, Dexterity, and
                Agility.  Strength is moderately useful, but don't
                concentrate on it.  Charisma is useless.

                After Luck, Dexterity, and Agility get in the 20s
                you'd be best off putting your points into
                Constitution.

                I will not accept a character with less that 17 IQ
                unless they've got extraordinary Luck, Dexterity,
                and Agility.

                Constitution is moderately important at the start.
                There's not really much difference between a 25 and a
                35.  If something's going to kill a character with 25
                CON, chances are it'd do likewise to someone with 35
                CON.  Only worry about Constitution if it's real low.

		A good IQ will more than make up for a low MaxCon.

                Plus you can always raise MaxCon by going up levels
                Harder to do without good skills or ability to
                inflict damage.

        1.2. Equipment

                Price - The price you buy things from stores.  Sale
                price is almost always 1/2 buying price.

                        * Cannot buy anywhere (PRICE represents resale)
                        # Can only buy in Darwin City

                        blow it up!  There are a few things TNT can't
                        blow up, but heavier ordinance can.

                        get out of your way or give you useful info.
                        Sell them when you find them; buy them back

                        find them for extra money.  Buy them back
                        when you want to use them.

                        PRICE   $15

                Sledge Hammer - Not too useful.  Might smash some
                        stuff up, I don't know.
                        PRICE   $25

                Jug - Used VERY late in the game.  Don't even bother
                        picking them up until you need them.  The
                        selling price isn't worth the effort to carry
                        them.
                        PRICE   $1

                Geiger Counter - Detects radiation.  VERY important!
                        Ever wonder what those 8 squares are on the
                        right side of the screen?  They're the geiger
                        counter reading.  When 6 squares are red,
                        you'd better get Rad Suits or turn back the
                        way you came.  If you wait until night
                        (18:00 to 6:00) you can see the radiation and
                        walk around it.  Get 1 per party.

           1.2.2 Weapons

                Range - An approximation.  Give it + or - 10'

                Armor - For projectile weapons, armor piercing tends
                        to be more important than raw damage
                        inflicted because most enemies have armor

                        From best to worst:
                        Excellent (near full damage to well armored)
                        Very Good
                        Good
                        Decent
                        Fair
                        Poor      (less damage to even light armor)


                Damage - Approximation based on unarmored enemies.
                         An average if it doesn't vary much.
                         A range if it does.

                        With high skill levels, damage inflicted by
                        melee weapons can by far exceed any other
                        weapons in the game.  With Level 6 Brawling
                        and 10 Strength, an Ax can do 145 damage per
                        round!  And that is by no means an upper
                        limit :)

                        Damage is also heavily influenced by Luck.

                        NOTE: All damages were inflicted by
                        characters with *very* high luck.  So the
                        damages will seem quite high.  But the damage
                        trends between weapons still hold.


                Reload - For single-use weapons, reload time is
                        vital.  With AT Weapons you only get to
                        attack every other round, but with
                        Demolitions you can attack every round.

        1.3 Skills

                The Heart of Wasteland.  This is what separates it
                from other RPGs.

                You can gain skills in Libraries.

                Numbers in brackets are base Skill Points Required.
                IQ is required.  I only added the ones I've actually
                found a real use for somewhere in the game.

                Check if your NPCs already have the skills before
                spending SKP on your characters.

                For each skill I STRONGLY recommend you get the
                starting skill level I state.  Getting less would be
                detrimental to your party's health.  Getting more
                would be a waste of Skill Points.

            Note:  With the exception of character creation in the
                Ranger Center, you can NEVER get a skill level higher
                than the character's experience level.  If you ever
                get to a point when you use skills frequently, but
                they never raise levels, try to get some promotions.

             Ex: A level 3 character cannot get level 4 brawling no
                matter how hard you try.  Keep that in mind.

            Note:  When it takes "255" SKP to go up a level, that is
                the highest you can ever possibly get by using the
                skill.  In other words, it is impossible to get more
                than level 8 in ANY skill by using it.  Skills that
                take 2 or 3 SKP for level 1 are stuck at level 7.

                You must use the Negative Skill Point Cheat to get
                higher than a Level 8 in any skill.


            IQ 3

		Brawling (1) - Gives an extra melee attack for every
			2 levels.  Everyone needs this.  Start with
			level 2.

                Climb (1) - Self-explanatory.  Try climbing on things
                        like tables and fences in addition to the
                        obvious.  Only one per party needs it.  Start
                        with level 1.

		Pugilism (1) - Increases damage done with FISTS.
			Everyone needs this.  Start with level 2.

                Swim (1) - Obvious.  It can be helpful, but not
                        required, for everyone.  Start with level 1
                        if at all.  Raise it by taking a leap in
                        the river.

                *Clip Pistol (1) - DON'T GET IT!  You get 1/2 the XP
                        of melee combat and pistols suck anyway.
                        Sell your pistols in Quartz first thing.

            IQ 6

                Perception (1) - Lets you see things that are hidden.
                        Only 2 people per party need it.  1 if he's
                        really good.  A level 4 or 5 perception
                        should cover the game.  Start with Level 1.

		Assault Rifle (1) - Lets you hit with them.  Everyone
                        needs it, but don't get it until Needles.
                        Start with Level 1 or 2.

                *AT Weapon (1) - I know I used to encourage this
                        skill, but I now realize it is not vitally
                        important.  It can still be somewhat useful
                         -- Spears are cheap AT Weapons that can do a
                        LOT of damage in the hands of a strong
                        person.  All AT Weapons are disposable.
			Start with level 2 if at all.

                SMG (1) - Lets you hit with them.  Everyone needs
                        this, but don't get it until Needles.  Start
                        with Level 1.

            IQ 10

                Acrobat (1) - Only need 1 per party.  I don't know if
                        any NPCs have it.  Start with level 1.

                Picklock (1) - Of utmost importance.  You'll need it
                        a lot.  Only 1 per party.  Start with
                        Level 2.

                Silent Movement (1) - Not quite sure how useful it
                        is.  Never was able to get a high level in
                        it.  Maybe if you did you could walk right
                        through the Citadel.  Never tried it.

                Gambling (1) - You can make a heck of a lot of money
                        early on with gambling.  Gambling also raises
                        in skill level VERY rapidly.  Most useful on
                        characters with high luck.  Start with
                        Level 1.

            IQ 13

		Demolition (1) - Fire, Fire, Fire!!! Huh, huh, huh.
                        Without it you'll blow yourself up with TNT
                        etc... (Works in combat too)
			Only 1 person needs it.  Start with level 1.

			If in doubt, blow it up!

            IQ 15

                Bomb Disarm (2) - Bomb traps are the deadliest things
                        you'll encounter in the game.  Save before
                        using it.  (ApplePC save state works well)
			Only 1 person needs it.  Start with Level 2+.

                Medic (2) - Very important, but hesitate to give it
                        to all characters.  Once you get an IQ in
                        the low 20s go to Las Vegas's library and
                        give everyone Doctor 1.  Doctor 1 can heal
                        Comatose people, Medic 40 cannot.  Level 1
                        Medic is completely useless.  Start with
			2 level 2 Medics.

                Safecrack (2) - Like picklock for big doors.  Only 1
                        person needs it.  Start with Level 1.

            IQ 16

                Cryptology (2) - Lets you decode messages/passwords.
			Only one person needs it.  Don't get it until
			Las Vegas.  Start with Level 1.

            IQ 17

                Metallurgy (2) - OK, it's not really a useful skill.
                        But it allows you to find the 2 silver veins
                        in the mine. (yawn)  Start with Level 1 on 1
                        person if at all.

            Doubtful skills:
			Knife fighting (3/1)
			Rifle (3/1)
			Knife Throwing (6/1)
			Confidence (11/1)
			Sleight of Hand (12/1)
			Forgery (13/1)
			Alarm Disarm (14/1)
			Bureaucracy (14/1)

            The tougher the problem is that you use a skill on, the
            more likely you are to raise the skill level.  Example:
            You're more likely to raise Assault Rifle skill by
            ripping a clip on a Guardian than on a rabbit.

            A good way to raise brawling is to equip yourself with a
            non-weapon, such as a match and fight something tough.
            Works with pugilism too.


        1.4 General Hints

                Don't drop anything you can sell.  I have amassed
                quite a fortune early on in the game by simply
                selling everything I find.

                Use melee combat whenever you can.  Ammo can get
                expensive.  Plus you get DOUBLE experience for melee
                combat.

                You can only see radiation at night, presumably it
                glows.  If your geiger counter goes wild wait
                until nighttime before proceeding.

                Demolitions weapons do damage to an entire group of
                enemies.  Don't waste them on singular enemies.

                If you ever get tied up, use Dexterity to free
                yourself.

                It is indeed true that low level characters can go
                up a few levels by simply evading during combat,
                but progess is much slower than simply killing the
                enemies.

                It's generally a good idea to back up your party in
                case they get saved in a place where they're stuck.

                If you're using an emulator, save the state before
                you do something risky.

           Enemy Morale:  Depending on how the battle's going, some
                enemies may try to run away.  There are basic rules
                you can use to determine the morale of an enemy.

                1) Animals and Robots almost NEVER run away.  They
                        fight to the death.

		2) Cornered enemies cannot flee.  Enemies will NEVER
			try to run around you into the open so they
			can get away.

                3) If a humanoid doesn't hurt you in 3 or 4 rounds,
                        he might run away.

                4) If a humanoid in a group is seriously injured
                        he'll run away.

                5) If a group of humans has taken multiple
                        casualties, the group may run away.  

                6) If your party can kill the enemy several times
                        over, he'll probably run away.

                7) If enough time passes, the enemy may come back
                        for more.

		8) Enemies with long range attacks often run to their
			maximum range and shoot you from afar.

                9) If enemies are fleeing, you can sometimes corner
                        them into a wall and pound the crud out of
                        them.

           With that said I never have to touch the morale issue
                again.

           There is typically no direct indication that a particular
           "opponent" is an NPC other than that NPCs will not attack
           unless you attack them.  Try not to kill your allies too
           often -- NPCs can be useful.

                Note:  There are several non-NPC people in the game
                        which will not attack, but that doesn't mean
                        that they're NPCs, or even friendly.


           Q: Which NPCs should I keep?

           A: It depends what stage in the game you're on.

                Radio often to see if your characters have gone up
                levels.  Remember, Radio also saves your game so
                don't Radio if you're in a sticky situation.

                Most of the early NPCs waste your ammo and don't do
                anything useful.  Use them as bullet catchers if you
                want.  They won't mind :)

                NPC's in this class include Jackie (in Highpool),
                Mayor Pedros (in Quartz), Ralf (in Needles), and
                Felicia (in Quartz)

                You'll know 'em when you see 'em.

                Drop 'em when they're dead or badly hurt if you don't
                have Medics/Doctors.

                Generally, when you find a new NPC, save the game.
                (ApplePC Save State works well)

                Hire the NPC (disband an old one if you have to) and
                see if he/she is any better than one of your current
                NPCs.  If so, keep the NPC.

                Criteria:

                        IQ - How many levels do they need before
                                they're useful.

                        CHR - How obedient they are.

                        MAXCON - Any NPC with less than 20 MAXCON is
                                probably a loser.

                        Equipment - 'Nuff said.

                        Skills - Do they have anything really useful?
                                Or are they worthless?

                        SKP - Most NPCs have some free Skill Points.

                        Rank - The LOWER the better.  If a low level
                                character is as good as a high
                                level character, 10,000 XP from now
                                the low level character will eat the
                                high level one for breakfast.  It's
                                easier to make lower level characters
                                powerful because they go up levels
                                much quicker.


           Q: There's lots of walls that look weak.  What do I do to
                them?

           A: Blow 'em up with TNT.  Works on doors too.  Some
                walls/doors are stronger than others and require more
                powerful ordinance.

                NOTE: Try picklock and safecrack on doors before you
                        blast 'em.  Try shovel, pick ax, ax, and
                        strength on walls first too.

           Hints:

                Be careful where you step.

                Don't fall in the river unless you are purposely
                trying to raise swimming.  

                Don't walk into the desert without canteens on
                everyone.

                Don't head East of the Ranger Center unless it's
                nighttime (18:00 until 6:00).  You'll see why.


                Q: My whole party suddenly got diseased with
                   something and died!  What happened.

                A: See above.  Wait until 18:00 and do it again.
                   You'll find out rather quickly.


                Q: My character died, how to I bring him back to
                   life?

                A: As I said before, this isn't a Fantasy RPG.
                   There's no magic.
                   Bury the character and make a new one.


                Q: How do I fix the jeep.

                A: You can't.  Only Ace (an NPC) can fix the jeep.
                   And then it's a waste of time -- it just drops
                   you in Las Vegas and gets stolen!

                   One of the larger disappointments in the game.

                   It can be seen as a method of advancing the plot
                   of the game, though.

                Plastic Explosives - A little more kick than TNT.
                        Quite expensive, so only use them when TNT
                        won't do the trick.
                        PRICE   #$300

                Chemical - You won't need it for a LONG time.  Just
                        let it sit there until you need it later on.
                        You cannot sell it, so it would just waste
                        a space in your inventory.

                   there.  Bring a rope too.


                Q: How do I get past the boulders in the cave?

                A: Use Climb skill.  Level 3+ helps immensely, but
                   isn't required.


                Q: I'm in the cave, but I can't find Jackie.  Where
                   is he?

                A: Kill Rex (see below).  Follow the tunnel North
                   and past some boulders.


                Q: Is there any way to avoid killing Rex?

                A: Despite popular myth, there is.  But I don't
                   recommend it.  Rex'll start a fight, but don't
                   attack.  Run Party North.  Then use Climb North.
                   Disband West a character with Climb and have him
                   rescue Jackie.  Keep evading with the other party.
                   Return the party with Jackie to the rest of the
                   party.  Then leave.  The dog is untouched.  And
                   unless you've got some good armor, your party is
                   trashed.  But you've got Jackie and Rex lives!

                   To tell the truth, just beat the snot out of Rex,
                   it doesn't matter.  I just wanted to prove that
                   it IS possible to save Jackie without killing the
                   dog.


                Q: Is there any hidden treasure in Highpool?

                A: Search under the beds.  That's a general rule
                   throughout all of Wasteland.  Also, fix the pump
                   with an engine.  You can buy one from the Trading
                   Car in the Nomad's camp.


                Q: How can I see something cool in Highpool?

                A: Become the Grim Reaper.  The juvies' time has come
                   (sinister laughing)

                   Seriously, cool stuff happens if you ruthlessly
                   slaughter everyone in Highpool.  To get everything
                   started, slip on the rocks by walking back and
                   forth across the river (not the bridge) Hate it
                   when people laugh at you?  Get your revenge!

                   You might want to avoid saving after doing so, though.

        2.4 Agriculture Center

           Hints:

                Before you kill Harry, walk next to the walls and get
                pelted by tomatoes.  Eventually your perception will
                rise, but it doesn't work too well.

                Jewelry and fruit sell for the highest prices in the
                Ag Center's store.  If you find any fruit or jewelry
                any time in the game -- sell it there.


                Q: What are fruit good for?

                A: For now, sell them.  You use them much, much later
                   Don't worry about it :)


                Q: Where's Harry the Bunny Master?

                A: Just scan all the rows of vegetables and you'll
                   find him.


                Q: What use is the root cellar?

                A: Not much.  There's usually a few things hidden in
                   the boxes.  Use Perception on the table 2nd from
                   the bottom.


                Q: Is there any hidden treasure in the Agriculture
                   Center?

                A: Yes.  You can use picklock to get at the treasure
                   hidden behind the doors.  Also check out the SW
                   corner of the Ag Center.  There's a hidden tunnel
                   with some goodies in it.



        2.5 Nomads' Camp

           Hints:

                Go see the Brakeman.

                The Nomad's Camp is an *EXCELLENT* place to get
                experience.  The battles are easy and the experience
                is high.  USE MELEE WEAPONS ONLY!  You get double
                the experience, and you don't need to waste ammo on
                these wimps.

                The casino car is very useful.  It is a low-stakes
                place to gamble.  As such it is an excellent place
                to raise gambling skill.  With decent luck, you can
                get gambling up to Level 8 in 5-10 minutes and lose
                less than $1000.

                Then take a trip to Vegas and watch the money roll in!

                Notice: remember that no skill level can ever be higher
			than the character's experience level.  If you
			have a level 4 character you can only have a
			maximum of level 4 gambling.  The only exception
			to this rule is character creation in the Ranger
			Center.


                Q: What do I do with that stinking bum?

                A: Give him something to drink.  Maybe he's not just a
                   stinking bum.  (Hint hint)


                Q: Is anything hidden in the Nomad's Camp.

                A: Besides the mini-quest, I assume.  Yes.  Try using
                   the Atchison's password on the other 2 tents and
                   see what happens :)


        2.6 Mine

           Hints:

                Bring a pick ax.

                Q: In the mine there are places where the wall has
                   been chipped and the rock looks strange.  Is it
                   any use?

                A: There's silver deposits there.  You need
                   Metallurgy to find the silver veins and a pick ax
                   to extract the silver.  To tell the truth, you get
                   a pitiful amount of money for the effort.  Your
                   Skill Points are better used elsewhere.


                Q: What are Gas Masks for?

                A: They are only used once in the entire game, and
                   even then aren't necessary.  Sell them.


        2.7 Quartz

           Hints:

                Use the manhole covers for some safe, quick transport

                There's a store in the SW corner of the city.

                The Bar is to the SouthEast, just West of the
                graveyard.

                The Courthouse is 2 blocks directly North of the Bar.

                The Inn is West of the Courthouse and 1 building to
                the North.

                In the Bar, go in the bathroom and talk to the person
                Say CHAT.

                If you give snake squeezins to a bum, he'll let you
                pass.


                Q: What do I do with Head Crusher?

                A: Go see the Brakeman in Nomad's Camp first.


                Q: OK, now how do I show him the Visa Card?

                A: Use it on yourself or the table, I forgot which.


                Q: What do I say to the Riddler?

                A: The first Answer is TOAST.  The second is R.  For
                   the 3rd answer talk to the Barkeep.


                Q: Is anything hidden in Quartz?

                A: Check out the graveyard.  Nothing real valuable,
                   but the tombstones are cool.  Also explore ALL the
                   rooms in the Inn.  Also in the Inn Climb over the
                   counter and raid the vault.  Be careful.  Jump on
                   the stage in the Bar and check out the Jukebox.
                   Shove the punks around.


             2.7.1 Courthouse

               Hints:

                Make sure you *finish* Scott's Bar and Stagecoach
                Inn before you come to the Courthouse.

                It's your choice whether you want to come in fighting
                or sneak in.


                Q: What's the Password?

                A: What's the matter?  Don't like a fight?

                        MUERTE


                Q: Danny Citrine's dead!  What do I do?

                A: When you entered and woke Louie he sounded the
                   alarm and Citrine was executed.  Try again until
                   Louie stays asleep and you knock him out.  Then
                   enter the room again and roast the enemies.


                Q: What do I do with Danny Citrine?

                A: First, to revive him give him a drink from your
                   canteen.  Then have him join your party and head
                   upstairs.  The SE jail cell holds Citrine's
                   father.  Bring Citrine in and step on the bed.

                        Moola!

                Q: I found Hewie and Dewey.  Where's Louie?

                A: I assume you didn't wake the guard and knocked him
                   out.  He was Louie.  You read Louie's bracelet,
                   remember? (P-107)


                Q: And what do I do with the Mayor once I have him?

                A: As far as I know, use him as a beast of burden
                   until someone better comes along, then disband
                   him forever.


                Q: And how about the other prisoners that I release?

                A: Doesn't matter.


           2.7.2 Ugly's Hideout

              Hints:

                Walking along the glass in the secret entrance can
                raise Perception, but it's a real pain to get it
                any higher than Level 2.


                Q: Where's the secret entrance to Ugly's hideout?

                A: Directly North of the Courthouse there's 2
                   buildings separated by 1 space.  The building to
                   the East is Ugly's hideout.  Notice the black
                   square directly SouthWest of the hideout?  That's
                   the secret entrance.  Carefully examine the walls.


                Q: What's the code for the vault?

                A: Use the numbers from the bracelets in the
                   Courthouse.  Note that the order of the numbers
                   is important.


                Q: Should I let Ugly John go?

                A: He does tell the truth and you do save Felicia.
                   But if you have a decent bomb disarm it's a
                   pretty simple trap.  You get some goodies for
                   killing Ugly John.  Other than that, it doesn't
                   matter.


                Q: Where the heck's this Ace NPC I keep hearing about?

                A: In the basement of Ugly's hideout.  Get to it by
                   way of stairs hidden behind a counter along the
                   East wall.  He's in a jail cell.  Try Picklock
                   and Safecrack.  Be patient, the doors WILL open.


        2.8 Needles

           Hints:

                Head to the Police Station first to find out what the
                heck is going on.

                There are several Bloodstaffs.  Only 1 is real.

                Check out the Ammo dump in NE Needles.

                Check out the trash pit in SW Needles.  Bring some
                TNT.  You'll be very glad you did.

                Leyroy's Place is also a decent weapons store.

                The shifting hills in Southern Needles can raise
                Climb.

                Search all buildings in Needles carefully.  Watch out
                for radiation.

                Hire the Uzi-toting female in the alley of downtown
                Needles.

                Needles is a poor place to gain experience.  For low
                level characters the fights are hard and the XP is
                terrible.  Do your business, then leave.


                Q: Are the shifting hills good for anything else?

                A: Disband a character with climb skill and have him
                   walk over the hills.  Check out the tops of the
                   hills.  It works best if you disband 1 character
                   to look (he must have Climb or Acrobat)


                Q: What can I do in the garage?

                A: Find Ace in Quartz, then have him check out the
                   jeep North of Quartz.


                Q: How do I disable the alarm in the Police Station?

                A: The Communications Center is near the center
                   Southern wall.  In the NE corner of the room
                   there's a panel.  Press Button 0.  Then get the
                   FREE SMGs and ammo to the East.

                Q: What do I do with the Ruby Ring?

                A: Show it to the priest in the building in SE
                   Needles.  Then toss it.


                Q: What do I do with the Bloodstaff?

                A: Give it to the priest in the building to the SE
                   of Needles


                Q: How do I get in the building in SE downtown
                   Needles?  I can't blow the door down.

                A: There are two drunks in a room nearby.  Give one
                   of them several snake squeezins and they'll tell
                   you the name of the club they got wasted at.  The
                   name of the club is also the Password.

                Q: Is anything hidden in Needles?

                A: There's a gang meeting going on behind some rubble
                   in downtown Needles.  You can get in a decent
                   fight back there and pick up some assault rifles
                   early on in the game.  Use howitzer shells on the
                   howitzer in downtown Needles.  You need
                   Demolitions or AT weapons.

           2.8.1 Temple of Blood

             Hints:

                If you wear Robes on everyone when you enter, very
                few enemies will fight you.  Put your regular armor
                back on when you're on the chess board.

                The electric chair is fully functional.  BZZZT!

                Don't step on the pressure plates.  It brings out
                one of the tougher enemies in the game.


                Q: How do I open all those doors?

                A: Picklock works wonders.


                Q: What's the solution to the Chess Puzzle?

                A: Come on, that's a fun one to solve.  Here's how to
                   do it: take a step.  If you just move and nothing
                   happens it's correct.  It's helpful to make a
                   little map of the Chess Board and put an X at
                   every correct step.  For the final question, if
                   you're certain you're right, but you're wrong try
                   increasing/decreasing the answer by 1.  It depends
                   how you count.

                Q: What's the launch code for the Nuclear Missile?

                A: If you really can't figure it out, it's MOTEKIM.

           3.1.1 Items

                Antitoxin - Just let it sit there for now, you brute.
                        You won't use it for a while yet.  No it
                        cannot heal diseased party members.

                Rockets - Function like Plastic Explosives for
                        demolition purposes.  Only a last resort when
                        you're out of everything else -- rockets are
                        worth a fortune!

        3.3 Las Vegas Misc.

           Hints:

                Watch out for land mines.

                There's a library in the SE corner -- check it out!

                There's a bum in the 2nd building West of the Library
		Give him some money and ask the following:

                There's a hospital on the 2nd Southernmost block, 4th
                building from the West on the North side of the
                street. (Wouldn't addresses have helped?)

                        3rd building West of Las Vegas Blvd and
                        Flamingo Ave.

                Temple of the Mushroom Cloud is at the very Eastern
                part of Las Vegas set off the road midway North/South

                The Casinos and golf course are in the center West

                The Jail is in the NE corner.  Check it out, but be
                careful.

                Talk to Fat Freddy.  Say "Yes" to his offer.  If you
                say "No" make sure you've got Gas Masks.

                The best place to gamble is at Fat Freddy's.  For
                lower stakes, 3-Card Monty at Spade's is pretty good.

                Q: Where the heck's the Sonic Key?

                A: Go to the very North end of the golf course.  You
                   should see 4 flags arranged in a somewhat
                   misshapen diamond.  There's a cactus in the center
                   The Sonic Key is buried 2 squares East of the
                   cactus. (Use a shovel to dig it up)

                   There's another one guarded by 10 Cyborg Commandos
                   a few squares SW of the Jail (NE corner).


                Q: Are there any hidden items in Las Vegas?

                A: Yes.  There's some ammo and a Proton Ax hidden in
                   the second building East of Scorpitron on the
                   South side of the street.


                Q: What's the password for Fat Freddy?

                A: Talk to the bum (see Hints)


                Q: Where's Covenant?

                A: In the jail in NE Las Vegas.



        3.4 Faran Brygo

           Hints:


                Faran Brygo's hideout is the second building West of
                Scorpitron on the North side of the street.  When you
                try to enter it says "Entering a small beat up
                building".  Don't worry -- it's really Faran Brygo.

                Once you press the button, you cannot come back!


                Q: What's the password for Faran Brygo?

                A: Go to Spade's Casino and walk up to the bar.


                Q: What can I do with the strange wall in Faran
                   Brygo's Place?

                A: Use Cryptology on it.  You'll be glad you did!


                Q: I killed Faran Brygo.  What useful stuff does he
                   have to say?

                A: Paragraph 7


                Q: I didn't kill Faran Brygo.  How can I get Fat
                   Freddy's reward?

                A: If you take out the Guardian Citadel, give Fat
                   Freddy the Onyx Ring contained within.

        3.5 Temple of the Mushroom Cloud

           Hints:

                Don't play around with the radioactive waste.
                There's nothing of value over there.


                Q: What's the password to get into the Temple of the
                   Mushroom Cloud?

                A: Look at the walls.


                Q: What do I say to Charmaine?

                A: Didn't Faran Brygo send you to see her?


                Q: How do I open the secret door?

                A: Use the Sonic Key.  Or else talk to Charmaine.



        3.6 Sewers

           Hints:

                Use ropes to cross the river and chasm.  Swimming
                works too, but ropes are much much easier.

                        Courtesy: Marc Sira
                                  <toh@freenet.victoria.bc.ca>

                Use a shovel to break through all the hollow walls.
                Explosives work too, but that's kind of wasteful.

                If your party is injured or low on ammo, feel free
                to leave and come back later after you freshen up.

                Go wild with your conventional ammunition.  After
                you finish the Sewers SMGs are almost useless and
                Assualt Rifle ammo is fairly cheap.

                If your weapon is empty you'll use it as a melee
                weapon.  If you don't have pugilism but you do have
                a high energy weapons, keep an empty Energy Weapon
                (likely a laser pistol) on hand.  When you strike
                with it it'll use your energy weapons skill in
                determining damage -- not pugilism.  Granted it won't
                do as much damage as fists and level 6 pugilism, but
                it'll still do about 40-70 damage per blow with a
                decent skill level.  Brawling still works no matter
                what melee weapon you're using.


                Q: What do I do with the Servo Motor? the Fusion
                   Cell? the ROM Board? the Android Head? the Power
                   Converter? etc...

                A: Save every one of the above that you can find.
                   They are necessary later on.


                Q: What do I do with the table?

                A: Run diagnostics on each section.  You'll find the
                   necessary parts strewn all over the sewers.  Don't
                   worry, they're all down there.  Just look.  Make
                   sure you open up every single passage with your
                   shovel.

        4.3 Sleeper Base

           Hints:

                There's no random encounters, so take all the time
                you want.

                There's not much fighting at all in Sleeper Base.


                Q: Where is Sleeper Base?

                A: You need to either revive Max or befriend the
                   Junkmaster to find Sleeper Base.  Sleeper Base is
                   in the NorthEast corner of the Big Map near the
                   source of the river.


                Q: Where do I find all the Secpasses?

                A: Secpass 1 - Pile of debris in the room just
                        West of the entrance on Level 1.

                   Secpass 3 - Pile of debris in one of the little
                        rooms South of the main entrance on Level 1.

                   Secpass 7 - On level 3 in a locked desk.

                   Secpass A - Use perception on a desk in the center
                        North of Level 2.

                   Secpass B - Guardian Citadel or Finster in
                        Darwin City.


                Q: What Secpass do I use to open door x?

                A: There's many doors in Sleeper Base and I'm not
                   going to mention every single one.  Just try all
                   the Secpasses you've got.  If it won't open come
                   back when you find a new Secpass.


                Q: How do I break the crystalline wall guarding the
                   big suits of armor?

                A: Despite what the game says, just blow it up with
                   Plastic Explosives.  It takes 4, I think.


                Q: How do I get past the shiny floor, electricity,
                   and dead doors without getting roasted?

                A: Disband 1 member of the party to the power
                   control room.  Turn power off to walk safely past
                   the electricity.  Turn power on to open doors.
                   Switch parties with 'v'.


                Q: How do I open "The most secure safe door you've
                   ever laid eyes on"?

                A: Picklock.  Safecrack might work too.


                Q: How do I fix the Helicopter Simulator?

                A: Use a ROM board on it.


                Q: How do I get in the Helicopter Simulator?

                A: Send 1 person at a time.  High dexterity helps.


                Q: How do I make clones?

                A: Go to level 2.  Use a Power Converter on the
                   broken generator in the NE corner.  Then head to
                   the room South of the room with the crystalline
                   walls.  Go to the machine and run Diagnostics.
                   Use Clone Tech skill (available on level 1) on the
                   machine. If it didn't work run diagnostics again
                   and repeat.

                   If it did work select 3) Install manual drainage.
                   Then use a jug on the machine.  Get the Clone
                   Fluid and give it to the character you want to
                   clone.

                   Send the character you want to clone alone into
                   one of the cloning chambers.  It takes a while to
                   incubate the clones.  I'm still not sure exactly
                   how long it takes.

                   When the clone's done release it and you'll get to
                   name it.  Make sure you've cleared an empty spot
                   in your party.

                   You can incubate up to 4 different clones at once.


        4.4 Darwin City

           Hints:

                Go to the Black Market.  I have no idea what the
                password is.  Kick their butts and grab their Uzis.
                Now enter the store and buy any conventional weapon
                your heart desires.

*********************************************************************
                Has anyone found the password for the Black Market?
                Where?
*********************************************************************

                You need Cyborg Tech to use the android head Virtual
                Reality gizmo with the android's head.


                Q: Can I finally do something with all that **** fruit?

                A: Yes.  Go to the little shack in the middle of the
                   city.  Find the little table.  Use fruit,
                   chemical, and Doctor on it to make Antitoxin.


                Q: Where can I get chemicals?

                A: There is one chemical in Housekeeping in the
                   Stagecoach Inn and there are three chemicals on a
                   table in Ugly's hideout.

                   If you're a meanie, you can also find some
                   chemicals and even an entire Antitoxin in Spade's
                   Casino.  Just massacre everyone and search what's
                   left.


                Q: That's great.  Now what do I use Antitoxin for?

                A: Check out the Darwin City bar.


                Q: Can I do anything else with Antitoxin?

                A: No, you cannot.


                Q: I have Cyborg Tech, but the android's head still
                   keeps exploding!

                A: You're using the wrong android's head.  Go see
                   Finster next door.  Then head to the lower level
                   and free the prisoners.  There's 2 ways to do this:

                        1) Enter Finster's desert world of the future
                           and leave through the cliff on the West.
                           Then unlock/destroy the door South of the
                           elevator.

                        2) Take the elevator to the lower floor.  If
                           you don't know the password, you'll be
                           bound and gagged.  Simply use Dexterity to
                           wriggle out.  Then leave.

                           To find the password, examine the SW cell
                           in the Quartz Jail.

                   Or else head down to Finster's "future" desert and
                   kill all his "pets".  Climb up the mounds and open
                   the hatches with Strength.

                   After that go and see Finster again.  He'll be
                   pretty pissed :)


                Q: I have Cyborg Tech.  I used the correct head, but
                   I still didn't log on!

                A: Try again.


                Q: OK.  I'm in the Virtual Reality place.  But I'm
                   stuck!

                A: Have no fear, the FAQ is here!

                   DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU WANT TO FIGURE OUT THE
                   HARDEST PUZZLES IN ALL OF WASTELAND BY YOURSELF!

                   I though you'd still be here :)

                   You don't need to kill the Night Terror, but he's
                        a lot of free experience.  Take as much time
                        as you like to kill him -- he won't hit you!
                   20
                   Walk around until you're in the NW corner.  Then
                        use IQ on yourself until you're in the SW
                        corner.  Then head East.

                   Next you have to play baseball.  I always hit
                        homeruns so I don't know what to do if you
                        fail.  I've heard you can use Luck and
                        Charisma to get out of the showers, but I
                        have not been able to verify it.  Save
                        before entering.

                Q: I entered the Virtual Reality part and I realize
                   I'm not prepared to solve it.  Can I leave and
                   come back?

                A: You can if you haven't gotten too far yet.  I
                   suppose I'd recommend just saving before you enter
                   (ApplePC save state works well)


        4.5 Guardian Citadel

           Hints:

                The Citadel is a LOT LOT easier if you take out the
                Sewer and Sleeper Base first.  Don't say I didn't
                warn you.

                If you have high enough Luck and Dexterity (25+) you
                can conquer the Citadel with Assault Rifles alone!
                Just go full-auto every round and you'll roast
                everything in 1 or 2 rounds.  More than 50% of the
                battles can be resolved with one 7.62mm clip if
                you've got a very good marksman.  If you sell 1 RPG-7
                you can buy 83 clips -- more than enough to conquer
                the entire Citadel.  If your aim's not THAT good, you
                can still do considerable damage with assault rifles
                and finish the job with an Energy Weapon or 2.  Save
                those power packs.

                Many Guardians rely solely on armor to survive; they
                have surprisingly low Hit Points once you pierce
                their armor.  I've killed some of them by doing only
                7 damage!

                Beware that the Guardians on the 3rd level are
                significantly more powerful than the rest.

                There are NO RANDOM ENCOUNTERS in the Citadel!  Feel
                free to leave any time to get healed/stock up on ammo

                You can only obtain power packs by finding them.  You
                cannot make them nor buy them anywhere in the game.
                (see cheats)

                You can sell power packs and buy them back later.
                (see cheats)

                Make sure you get all 4 special keys: Pulsar, Quasar,
                Blackstar, and Nova.

                Use perception on anything that looks suspect.


                Q: How do I open the vault in the first section?

                A: Safecrack.  Level 1 works just fine :)

                   Picklock will work too, but with a high level the
                   probability is still pretty low.


                Q: How can I avoid the traps in the vault?

                A: Leave at least 1 item in each treasure bag.  I
                   suggest a 7.72mm Clip or a Power Pack.


                Q: How do I open the display cases in the museum?

                A: Picklock.


                Q: How do I open the portcullus as the top of the
                   stairs?

                A: Just West of the stairs there's a door.  Go in the
                   door and use Strength on the wheel/chain.  A 20+
                   Strength helps a lot.  18 Strength will work, but
                   it's a pain.


                Q: How do I board the helicopter?

                A: You need someone with Helicopter Pilot skill from
                   Sleeper Base.


                Q: Is anything hidden in the Citadel?

                A: Look carefully through the 2nd room West of the
                   stairs.  Lots of useful stuff.  Use Perception on
                   the desks.


                Q: How do I open the vault upstairs?

                A: Look carefully at all the beds in the Inner
                   Sanctum.  Or else search the desk 2 rooms to the
                   West.

                
                Q: Where's the Blackstar Key?

                A: Use perception on the Altar in the Inner Sanctum.


        4.6 Savage Village

           Hints:

                There are 2 possible ways to use Savage Village:

                        1) Early on in the game slaughter everyone
                           and get a load of assault rifles/ammo.

                        2) After the Citadel use it to reveal Sleeper
                           Base and Base Cochise instead of using the
                           Sewers.

                           Then you can kill everyone :)
		
                Personally, I prefer method 1.  The Sewers work just
                fine plus give you your first taste of decent energy
                weapons, Laser Rifles.  Then you can build strength
                in Sleeper Base before cracking the Citadel.

                You don't need Redhawk to please the Junkmaster.
                He'll accept the Grazer Bat Fetish too.  (it's in the
                museum)


                Q: What's the password?

                A: REDHAWK is all the passwords.


                Q: Should I drop my weapons?

                A: Yes, they're just checking.  They don't really
                   take your weapons.


                Q: How do I get out of the well?

                A: Doh!  Climb skill.


                Q: Is anything hidden in Savage Village?

                A: Not really.  Everything's pretty much out in the
                   open.


        4.7 Base Cochise

           Hints:

                To find Base Cochise either use the Helicopter in the
                Citadel or search for a map in Sleeper Base (tells
                you to read a paragraph).  The map is referring to
                location relative to *Sleeper Base*, NOT Darwin City.

                If you enter Base Cochise via Helicopter make certain
                you have Secpass B and take a rope with you.  Also
                when you enter via helicopter it kills almost all the
                enemies outside the base.  Personally, I prefer
                getting the experience from the fights.  Plus when
                you enter by helicopter it shows the wrong location
                on the Big Map to purposely mislead you.  When you
                exit Base Cochise you exit from a different place.

                Personally, I walk and kick some tail! (You still
                need Secpass B)

                Take a large amount of powerful explosives with you.

                Again, if your Luck and Dexterity are high enough you
                can even defeat Base Cochise with assault rifles
                alone.  By now those 7.62mm clips should seem cheap
                as dirt, so don't worry about wasting money on them.

                Wait for nighttime (18:00 to 6:00) before solving
                Level 5.  You know what that means!


                Q: How do I get past the Southernmost door at the
                   perimeter of Base Cochise?

                A: Good old fashioned Boom Boom. (Explosives, for the
                   clueless)


                Q: I entered via Helicopter.  I can't go anywhere!

                A: Blast open one of the partially retracted thingies
                   (the round things at the center).  Then toss down
                   a rope and use Climb.

                   Take the treasure before you leave.


                Q: What should I type into the computer past the
                   escalators?

                A: Whatever you do, don't type BREAK.  It'll put you
                   in a very bad position to cross a pit.


                Q: After the escalators, where can I go?

                A: Search the Eastern wall very carefully.


                Q: OK, I got to the 4th level. What do I do?

                A: Go in each one of the "Vaults" and complete the
                   little quest.  The pipes and the weather work best
                   if you only send in 1 character.  They're all
                   pretty easy.


                Q: How do I open the 4 doors on the lower level?

                A: No keys work.  Blast 'em.  Use Plastic Explosives
                   or Rockets.


                Q: How do I get past the "indestructible" walls on
                   level 5?

                A: Send someone to fix the machine in the NW corner.
                   He'll need explosives and a power coupler.


                Q: How do I get past the conveyor belt on level 5?

                A: Destroy the fragile machinery in the Northern part
                   of the room.


                Q: I got to the 4 corners but I can't seem to get any
                   farther.

                A: You must disband 4 parties -- 1 to each corner.


                Q: Which keys go where and in what order do I press
                   the buttons?

                A: Did you think I was going to solve the WHOLE game
                   for you?

                   It's pretty easy to figure out which keys go
                   where -- trial and error.

                   Also it's pretty easy to figure out the
                   destruction sequence.  I'll give you these clues:

                        1) The game TELLS you what colors to use, if
                           you paid attention.

                        2) The order is not circular.


                Q: OK, I've got a live nuclear weapon sitting under
                   my nose.  How the heck do I get out without
                   becoming part of the stratosphere?
                   (It looks pretty cool, by the way.  You should try
                   it sometime)

                A: Time is very important.  Combine your 4 parties as
                   efficiently as you can.  Then head for an escape
                   pod a few squares North of the center ladder.


                Q: Is anything hidden in Base Cochise?

                A: On the 3rd Level (after escalators, before vaults)
                   send the platform across the radioactive pit.
                   Then head across to a room with a bunch of robot
                   generators.  Pick the locks.  One of them should
                   say "BREAK IN PROGRAM >".  Type "RUN" and select

6. Cheating

        You really thought there was such a thing as a CRPG you can't
        cheat at?  Not a chance.  You just need to be a little
        creative for Wasteland because the programmers did a good job
        trying to stop people from cheating.

        This section makes the game a little too easy, so I'd
        recommend against it the first time you play.  It'd just
        defeat the fun of the wonderful game.

	However after you solve the game, go wild the next time!


	6.1 Disk Switching

                Enter an area with a copy of the original disk, then
                place another copy in the drive after the area is
                loaded.  Do what you want, take all the treasure you
                want, hire whoever you want, kill whomever you want,
                then leave.  The stuff will be saved as modified on
                the disk you placed in the drive BUT THE FIRST DISK
                WILL BE UNCHANGED.

                You can just place the first disk in the drive and
                repeat the process.  An easy way to rack up items,
                cash, allies, and experience.

                It saves what you buy and sell too.  The stores
                rarely run out of things they're originally stocked
                with, but if you sell them 2 power packs they only
                have 2 power packs in stock for you to buy again
                later.

                But if you are creative with the disk-switching
                technique you can work around this too.

	6.2 Negative Skill Point Cheat

                If you go to a library and a skill requires 255 SKP
                for the next level, there's a bug in the program that
                treats it as a NEGATIVE 1!

                Just hit the key as if you were trying to get level 1
                It'll raise your skill level by 1 and give you a
                skill point in return.

                So you gain a skill point for getting a skill level!

                Note: You need to have at least as many SKP as it
                        takes to get level 1 in the skill for this
                        to work.  Always keep 3 SKP on hand and it's
                        not a problem.

                Note: Your skill level can never be higher than your
                        experience level, so there is a limit on how
                        high you can go.  Conversely, remember to
                        take a trip to the Library after you get
                        a few promotions.  VERY important thing to
                        keep in mind when using low level characters.

                Note: Because this bug likely comes from a problem
                        with signed vs. unsigned arithmetic, when you
                        have 127 SKP the computer thinks you actually
                        have -1 SKP which is less than the
                        requirement for level 1, so the cheat stops
                        working until you spend some SKP.  If you
                        want to raise a skill that takes 128 or 192
                        SKP you need to get the skill points by
                        getting some promotions and raising IQ.

                I'll use energy weapons as my example.  Level 1 takes
                3 skill points.  Every level doubles the previous
                requirement, so level 2 takes 6, 3 takes 12, etc...
                But what if you want level 8 Energy Weapons?  It
                would take 384 skill points, but the Apple // can't
                count that high on one register.  You can achieve
                Level 7 by fighting and using the skill, but not Level 8.

                To get level 8 go to a Library.  It'll say you need
                255 Skill Points to go up another level.  It's lying.
                If you try to increase your level the register loops
                around to a negative and you actually GET ANOTHER
                SKILL POINT FOR GOING UP A LEVEL.  Your skill level
                can never be higher than your experience level so
                don't be frightened when the process stops.  Just go
                kill some more, radio, then try again.

                It's very hard to get Pugilism and Brawling to
                Level 8.  You might just want to spend the Skill
                Points.

                Note: You can raise Brawling/Pugilism to Level 8 on
                        Level 5 of Base Cochise with all those little
                        Robots popping out of the floor.  But it's
                        tricky.  It checks Brawling first, then
                        Pugilism.  If you've got good Brawling, it
                        will never even test Pugilism.

                Also you might want to get some useless skills that
                are easy to raise in level so you can spend negative
                skill points in the library on them :)

                One use of a Laser Pistol is to fight a powerful
                enemy and keep going full auto at it with the Laser
                Pistol.  You won't hurt it, but it will raise your
                Energy Weapons.

                You can start the Negative Skill Points Cheat early
                on as soon as you get Level 9 characters.  Go to
                Fat Freddy and get a quick $1000 by offering your
                services.  He doesn't know that you won't make good
                on your promise for some time.  Go to a Library and
                get Gambling Level 1 on a lucky character.  Then head
                for Nomad's Camp and go to the Casino Car.  Keep
                betting until you've got Level 8 Gambling.  Then go
                to a library and the process has started.


	6.3 Infinite Money

                At the start of the game each character starts with
                piddly cash and some cheap equipment.  For a head-
                start make a bunch of characters and trade the
                pistols to the first guy and have him P)ool cash.
                Then delete the losers and do it over again.  When
                the first guy's inventory is full of pistols save the
                game and create a band of some more losers to take
                with him.  You can use a similar technique on each
                one to rake in even more cash if you've got the time.
                Then make a mad dash to Quartz.  There's a store in
                the South-West corner.

		Sell EVERYTHING.

                P)ool all cash to one character then return to the
                Ranger Center.  Don't worry if one of them dies.

                Delete all the characters except the one with the
                dough, then make your first REAL character.  Give him
                all the money and delete the old guy.  Then create
                the rest of your party.  Not an immense boost but
                it'll give you about $10,000 each repetition.

                Later on you can use the disk-swapping method to
                bring in major money with expensive equipment.

        6.4 Apple // Supercharacter walk-through

                To get XP I used to go through the Citadel.

                The perimeter of Base Cochise works much better.

                But here's my secret: Night Terror.  Just use disk
                switching and kill him over and over again.  Each
                time is 64,000 XP, more than slaughtering the
                entire Citadel.

                However to do it efficiently you need to almost have
                solved the game.  On the bottom level of Base Cochise
                there's a room with robots in the floor that
                challange your brawling first, pugilism second if
                brawling fails.

                You can get level 8 in both if you do it enough
                times.  I highly recommend having at least level 6
                before trying it.  Get pugilism by killing everything
                in the Citadel with your fists.  Get brawling by
                doing likewise with a chainsaw.  Always use the
                lowest skill level characters to do it.

                If you don't the high level ones will always kill the
                enemy before the lower level guys have a chance to
                raise their levels.

                Once you go to a library and see a skill require 255
                skp to go up a level you're home free.  If you've got
                enough skp to get level 1 in that skill (3 for energy
                weapons) then you can raise the skill up levels until
                it reaches your experience level, each time getting a
                skill point in return.

                An example.  Get level 7 Energy weapons by torching
                Brother Goliath (the first guardian) with laser
                pistols repeatedly.  He'll likely never get hurt.
                Go full-auto on him over and over again until you hit
                level 7.  Then give the next character a try.

                OK.  Now head to a library.  The next level should
                take 384 skp, but only 1 byte is used to represent it
                so it maxes out at 255.  Suppose you have 0 skp and
                experience level 14.  Select the skill and it will
                say "Not Enough Skill Points"

                Get that character up 2 levels and give him 3 IQ.
                Now he's level 16.

                Now go back to the library and try again.  You'll
                get level 8 Energy Weapons and have *4* skp.  Keep
                doing it and you'll end with level 16 energy weapons
                and *12* skp.

                You can do this with any skill.  The trick is finding
                a skill that can be raised to the critical level this
                way.  I have found 4.  In order of ease to do it:
                gambling, energy weapons, brawling, and pugilism.

                You could probably also do it with Assault weapons
                and SMG.

                Gambling is REALLY easy to do this with, but it'll
                cost you about $1000 depending on your Luck.

                Get gambling level 1.  Go to the Nomad's camp.  Find
                the casino car and enter it (in the back).  Keep
                gambling until you hit level 8.  It took my
                characters about 2 minutes a piece, but they had 40
                luck at the time.

                Anyway, after you get level 8 brawling, raise it as
                high as it can go.  Then equip a chainsaw, or
                preferably a proton ax.  If you have Level 8+
                pugilism screw weapons and use your fists.  Now
                you'll hurt that darn Night Terror pretty good!
                (And just about anything else in the game as well)

        6.5 Super Loot Bag Cheat

                The Super Loot Bag cheat is a method where you can
                supposedly get a loot bag containing a great number
                of every item in the game.  Included in the bag are
                a Red Ryder Rifle that does tremendous damage and
                an armor that has an AC127.

                It is quite possible indeed that this cheat does
                exist.  Unfortunately I have been unable to verify
                its existance, personally.  You are free to try and
                I would be very interested if it works.

                This definitely does SOMETHING, and I feel I've
                almost gotten it to work.  I think I'm just missing
                a single step.

                Here's the cheat to the best of my knowledge:

                        1) Go to either the Acapulco Club in Needles
                           or Fat Freddy's in Las Vegas.

                        2) Disband a single character and gamble
                           until he/she wins, but do NOT pick up
                           the cash.

                        3) Move the character to another seat and
                           gamble again until you win, but don't take
                           the cash.

                        4) Go back to the first loot bag and take the
                           money.

                        5) Drop an item.  It can be anything; try a
                           clip of ammo.

                        6) Walk over to the other bag and when it
                           locks up press down and then hit escape.

                        7) If the cheat worked, the previously empty
                           loot bag is filled with goodies.

                Obviously I'm having trouble with step 7 :(

                At step 6 the bag appears just like a normal loot bag
                with the sole exception that there is absolutely
                nothing in it.

                So hitting down and escape does nothing.

I'd welcome any help in getting this cheat to work properly!

7. Revision History

        12-16-1995, by Stephen Sedmak <sedmaks@odo.msoe.edu>
                Hey!  It exists!

        01-10-1996, by Chris Baer <chbaer@cris.com>
                Doubled the Q&A section, added several comments,
                introduced a partial account of real paragraphs,
                and introduced the "Legal Fine Print" section.

        02-25-1996, by Stephen Sedmak <sedmaks@odo.msoe.edu>
                A total rework of the entire FAQ.  Split into
                multiple sections and multiplied several times
                the total amount of Wasteland-related info.

        02-27-1996, by Chris Baer <chbaer@cris.com>
                A maintenance release available only via WWW.
                Mainly corrected some errors in the 02-25-1996
                version of the FAQ.

        03-31-1996, by Stephen Sedmak <sedmaks@odo.msoe.edu>
                A semi-major revision, mainly adding statistics
                for all the weapons and armor.  Also decided
                to add the Supercharacter Walk-Through I created
                in 1/96.  This is NOT an update to the 02-27-1996
                version, rather the 02-25-1996 version.  Changes
                from the 02-27-1996 version were added indirectly.
                Some e-mail comments by Chris Baer were pasted
                into the FAQ.

8. In planning for future versions

        We don't really have any more changes in mind at this time.

        I started gathering stats on the enemies but it was far too
        time consuming.  Hey, I *do* have a life beyond Wasteland,
        you know :)

        If something comes up we may find the time to do a small
        revision in the future.
