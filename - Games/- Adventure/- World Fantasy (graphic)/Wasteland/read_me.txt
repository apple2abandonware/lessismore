Use the speedy_copy_for_wasteland.dsk to copy
wasteland_1a_side1_boot.nib to a physical 5.25 floppy if you want to run
Wasteland on a real Apple.

Use Disk Muncher to copy the remaining Wasteland .nib disks.

Note that boh Speedy Copy and Disk Muncher will only copy correctly if
the copy is made using a physical computer.
