         Marc Miller (FarFuture@aol.com) has graciously agreed to
         release the following three text adventures as freeware.
         They are:

         Starcrystal, Episode I - Mertactor: The Volentine Gambit
         Space I
         Space II

         Originally  released  in  the  mid-80's  for  the  Apple
         computer, they  are currently being  re-released in both
         their original  format (as shrinkit files),  and as disk
         images  which can  then be   played with  the use  of an
         emulator upon most current computer platforms.

         These three text adventures were written for TRAVELLER -
         a science  fiction  role-playing  game  that  was  first
         published in 1977. Over  twenty years later TRAVELLER is
         alive and  well,  and  is currently  entering  its fifth 
         edition. Look for it at a hobby or comic shop near you.

         If  you'd like  to write  your own  text adventures  for
         TRAVELLER, the  authoring software is  freely available,
         and  easily  downloaded  from  the  Interactive  Fiction
         Archive at: ftp.gmd.de/if-archive

         Many thanks to Charles Turley  for his assistance in the
         conversion and release of these games as freeware.

         Enjoy,
