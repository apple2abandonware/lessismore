The Ultima IV secret VIRTUE BACKDOOR

	Unknown to many people, there is a secret BACK DOOR in Ultima IV
	that can tell you how you are doing on your virtues (honesty,
	sacrifice, etc...) by way of either you are ready to meditate, you
	are already part Avatar in that virtue or it will tell you a 1-97
	scale on how well you are doing.  To bring this un-documented
	feature up, press CTRL-S (status?).  You will get a 16 digit
	number...don't despair!  The digits are actually 8 numbers (2 digits
	per number) and they are your readouts on the virtures IN THIS
	ORDER: Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor,
	Spirituality, and Humility.

	If the number is a 99 that means you are ready to go to the shrine
	(rune and mantra required!) and meditate for three cycles...then you
	will become part Avitar in that virtue.  A 00 means you are already
	part Avitar.

An example:  you press CTRL-S and get this:

0056992200298404

 I'd recd it like this: you are already part Avitar in the virtue
 honesty, you need to have some work on compassion, you are ready to
 meditate for valor, you need LOTS of help (22?!?) in justice and you
 are already part Avitar in the virtue sacrifice, you need (again) lots
 of help with honor and you are almost there for spirituality, and you
 might as well give it up (04!) for humility.
