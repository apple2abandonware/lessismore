Rescue at Rigel uses a modified version of the same engine as Temple of
Apshai, and a hybrid form of room descriptions along with time limited
play. The player enters a space station to rescue 10 hostages from
insectoid aliens, the Tollah. Hostages get teleported around the station
if the player is not fast enough to rescue them, and the overall mission
is limited to 50 minutes. Instead of unique descriptions for numbered
rooms, the game has multiple rooms labeled "Sanctum", for example, and a
detailed description the room types is given in the manual.
