Telengard was originally "DND", a 1976 version of Dungeons & Dragons for
the DECsystem-10 mainframe computer. After 1978 it was rewritten for the
Commodore PET 2001, Apple II+, TRS-80, and Atari 800 platforms, then
Avalon Hill found the game at a convention and licensed it for
distribution.

Telengard is of the first professionally produced computer role-playing
games ever, and hails as one of the original mainframe dungeon crawls,
though other other mainframe incarnations existed with similar gameplay
such as Rogue, Moria, Oubliette, and Hack.
