1 ... West Tamir



Problem:



How can I get Pan to stop dancing?  He won't listen to me!

Hint:

There's only one thing that will stop Pan from listening to his

music...and that's listening to YOUR music.

Hint:

You need to find a way to play music around Pan.

Hint:

How about a lute!  He might like lute music!

Hint:

If you can get the lute from the minstrel, play it around Pan.

He'll stop and listen to your music.  You might even GIVE

him the lute.



Problem:

I want the fisherman's fishing pole, but he won't give it to me!



Hint:

You can't just TAKE the fishing pole; it's not yours!  If you

want it, you have to buy it or trade for it.

Hint:

The fisherman is very poor.  Don't you have anything of value

that you could give in trade for the fishing pole?

Hint:

Since his fishing pole is the fisherman's sole means of survival,

it is precious to him.  The only thing that would cause him

to give up his fishing pole is to give him the pouch of

diamonds in trade.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!



Problem:

Will the fisherman's wife do anything for me?



Hint:

Not really.  She's kind of a grouch.

Hint:

You can give the diamond pouch to either her or her husband, but

that's about all.

Hint:

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!

 

Problem:

All the minstrel does is play these bad songs for me!  Can I take his

lute?



Hint:

No, you can't TAKE his lute.  But you might be able to give him

something else in return for it.

Hint:

The minstrel is not very good at being a minstrel.  Maybe he

needs to take up a new line of work.  How about being an

actor!

Hint:

Since the minstrel is not a very good musician, he might be more

interested in taking up acting.  Give him the Shakespeare

book in trade for his lute.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!



Problem:

Where does Genesta live?  I can't find her.



Hint:

Genesta lives on an island in the ocean.

Hint:

If you swim in the ocean a couple of screens, you will run into

Genesta's island.  Be careful of the sharks, though.  It

would be wise to save your game before venturing into the

ocean.



Problem:

All right!  I give up!  The unicorn is no longer afraid of me...but

it won't follow me.  Is there a bridle somewhere?



Hint:

You're absolutely correct; there IS a bridle somewhere!

Hint:

Oh, you want to know where?  Well, this answer gets rather

complicated.  You will find the bridle on the desert island

(not Genesta's island).

Hint:

First, you need to get swallowed by the whale.  But before you

do that, make SURE you have the peacock feather and the dead

fish.

Hint:

Once you get swallowed by the whale, you need to climb its tongue

and then "tickle" its throat with the peacock feather.  The

whale will sneeze you out into the ocean again.  You will

then see a small desert island.  Swim to the small island.

The bridle is inside the wrecked rowboat.  Feed the fish

to the pelican to be able to leave the island and get

back to the mainland of Tamir.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!

 

2 ... East Tamir



Problem:

I want to enter the ogres' house, but it's locked!



Hint:

Be patient.  Eventually you will be able to enter the house.

Hint:

There are some things you need to do before you can enter the

ogres' house.

Hint:

The ogres' house will not be unlocked until Lolotte asks for the

magic hen.  Lolotte will not ask for the magic hen until you

have taken the unicorn to her.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!



Problem:

Now that I'm able to enter the ogres' house, a big ferocious dog

chases me out again!  What do I do with him?!



Hint:

Do something nice for the dog.  Think about what dogs like best.

Hint:

How about giving the dog a bone?

Hint:

You'll find a bone to give to the dog behind the waterfall.

Getting behind the waterfall is another question.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!



Problem:

I know the magic hen is supposed to be in the ogres' house, but I

can't find her!



Hint:

You don't need to find her.  If you do the right things, her

presence will be made known.

Hint:

When you're in the ogres' house you don't need to find the hen.

Just make sure you avoid the ogre and the ogress.  Hide

from the ogre when he comes home.

Hint:

Hide in the closet when you know the ogre is coming home.

You'll notice that there is a keyhole that you can look

through.  Look through it.  You'll see a cartoon sequence

showing the hen being brought to the ogre.  When the cartoon

sequence is finished, you can then leave the closet and get

the hen.  Be quick about it, though.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!



Problem:

How can I get through the scary forest without being caught by the

awful trees?



Hint:

There's only one way to do it; you need to get something that

will scare the wits out of them.  Think about what might

scare a tree.

Hint:

There is something in the ogres' house that you need to get.

This object will scare the trees so badly they will let you

pass unharmed.

Hint:

There is an axe in the ogres' bedroom that you can get.  When

you are in the scary forest say "Swing the axe." Your axe

will scare the trees so much they will then leave you alone.

Hint:

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!

 

Problem:

I keep getting killed by the three witches in the skull cave!!



Hint:

There are two ways that you can get caught by the witches.  One,

is when you're trying to GET the glass eye, and, two, is

when you're trying to avoid the one witch who continually

chases you.  Most importantly, SAVE YOUR GAME when you

first enter this cave!  Then, to get the eye, maneuver the

chasing witch to the front of the cauldron before attempting

to go after it.  You want the chasing witch as far away from

you and the other witches as possible.  Now, go toward the

other witches.  Go right up to where they are passing the eye

back and forth and VERY QUICKLY type in "Get the eye." (On

some versions of this game you can have "Get the eye"

pre-typed-in.  In this case, just press "enter" when you

get close to the glass eye.)  Once you have the glass eye,

the witches can no longer harm you.

Hint:

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!



Problem:

Now that I got the glass eye from the blind witches; what do I do

with it?  Should I give it back to them?



Hint:

Congratulations on getting the eye!  That's not easy to do.

Actually, you don't DO anything with the glass eye.  It's

not useful to you, only to the witches; and they want it

back desperately.

Hint:

You can't DO anything with the glass eye.  Only the witches can

use it.  The witches will give you something in return for

their glass eye; but being nasty and selfish witches, they

won't indicate that at first.  It will be a mistake to give

them back their eye right away. You need to scare them a

little first.

Hint:

DON'T give the witches back their glass eye right away.  They

will give you something in return for their eye if you scare

them a little, first.  They are completely helpless without

it, but they are also nasty and selfish.  If they feel that

you would really walk off with their eye, they will give in

to you.  Walk out of the cave with the eye.  The next time

you enter the cave the witches will throw something to you,

and will then beg for the return of their eye.  You can get

this object.  As to whether you EVER give the eye back to the

witches, that's up to you.

Hint:

I am inside, now what?

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!

 

Problem:

I love the epitaphs on the tombstones in the cemetery!...but do they

mean anything?



Hint:

Yes, some do.  They're not all just for show.

Hint:

It won't be apparent at first that some of the epitaphs are

useful.  After nightfall, it will become more obvious.

Hint:

Some of these epitaphs have to do with the haunted house; and the

inhabitants of the house.

Hint:

After nightfall, you will encounter five ghosts in the haunted

house.  Each of these ghosts wants something that is buried

in the cemetery.  The epitaphs indicate which is THEIR

particular grave.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!

 

Problem:

I dug some holes in the cemetery and then my shovel broke!  Now what

do I do?!



Hint:

Now you're out of luck!

Hint:

You can only dig FIVE holes in the cemetery before the shovel breaks.

Hint:

There are FIVE ghosts that you will meet in the haunted house,

and there are only FIVE holes that you can dig in the

cemetery.  Just be sure that you dig in the right place for

the right reasons before you start indiscriminately digging

holes.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!

 

Problem:

How do I go inside the crypt?



Hint:

If you do the right things you eventually will be able to enter

the crypt, but not until near the end of the game.

Hint:

You will not be able to enter the crypt until after nightfall;

and after Lolotte has asked for Pandora's Box.

Hint:

There is a key that you can get which is inside the haunted

house.  This key will unlock the crypt door.  You can't

get the key, though, until after nightfall, after you have

dealt with the witches, and after exorcising all five ghosts.

(It's in the organ.)

Hint:

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!

 

Problem:

Okay, I got the pouch of diamonds.  What do I do with it?



Hint:

Is it YOURS to do something with?...did the dwarfs specifically

GIVE it to you?...or did they just leave it behind?

Hint:

If the dwarfs just left the diamond pouch in the house, then it

is not really YOURS to do something with.  If you were an

honest person, and somebody left behind a valued object,

what would you do with it?

Hint:

If the dwarfs just left the diamond pouch in the house, then it

is not really YOURS.  You need to RETURN the forgotten

diamond pouch to them.  Take it to the diamond mine and

give it back to one of the dwarfs.  He will be touched by

your kindness and honesty and will let you KEEP the diamond

pouch PLUS give you something else (a lantern). Now you may

give the diamonds to the fisherman in trade for his pole.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!

 

Problem:

I want to enter the haunted house at night, but each time I try a

zombie gets me!  Help!

Hint:

You have to scare off the zombie first.

Hint:

You need to carry something that scares the zombies.

Hint:

The witches have something that will scare the zombies.

Hint:

The witches have a scarab that will ward off the undead.  Once

you have that, the zombies will no longer bother you.

Hint:

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!

 

3 ... Out In the Ocean



Problem:

Will the shark ever help me in any way?



Hint:

Absolutely not!  Stay away from the shark!



Problem:

The wale swallowed me.  Is this supposed to happen?



Hint:

Yes, you are.  But not until the right time.

Hint:

Yes, you are supposed to be swallowed by the whale, but you need

a couple of items, first.

Hint:

You are supposed to get swallowed by the whale, but make sure

you have the peacock feather and the dead fish before you do.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!



Problem:

Can I do anything with the peacock?



Hint:

No.  The peacock is there only for show and for a hint that there

may be a peacock feather that you can get.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!

 

Problem:

After escaping the whale I found myself on a desert island.  How do I

get back to Tamir?



Hint:

You need help from a fine-feathered friend.

Hint:

If you're nice to the pelican, the pelican will be nice to you.

Hint:

That pelican sure looks hungry!

Hint:

I hope you have the dead fish.  Throw it to the pelican.  The

pelican will then drop a silver whistle from its mouth.  Use

this whistle to summon a friendly dolphin.  The dolphin will

help you back to Tamir.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!

 

4 ... Haunted House



Problem:

How can I open the trap door in the ceiling of the upstairs bedroom?



Hint:

The trap door cannot be opened until nighttime.  Then, the little

boy ghost will open it for you.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!



Problem:

I "played" the organ, but nothing happened.  I think there's more to

the organ than this!



Hint:

You're right, there is.  It's just not time to know what it is,

yet.

Hint:

Later on, you'll be able to "play" another song on the organ.

This time, something WILL happen!

Hint:

You need to deal with the ghosts before you can do anything of

importance with the organ.

Hint:

You won't be able to do anything with the organ until AFTER you

have met all the ghosts.  The little boy ghost will lead

you to the attic where you will discover some sheet music.

If you "play" the song from the sheet music on the organ,

you will discover a skeleton key!

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!



Problem:

How do I stop the baby ghost from crying?  I've tried everything!



Hint:

The baby ghost WANTS something!

Hint:

The baby ghost wants something that is in the cemetery.

Hint:

Look in the cemetery for a baby's grave.  Dig there.  (Hopefully,

you have the shovel.)

Hint:

Read the epitaphs on the tombstones in the cemetery.  One of the

graves is a baby's.  If you have the shovel, you can dig

there.  You will find a silver rattle.  Give it to the baby

ghost.

need there...IF you have the shovel.

Hint:

It's DARK in this cave!  How can I see in here?!



Hint:

You need a light source.

Hint:

You can get a lantern from the Seven Dwarfs.

Hint:

If you're nice, and honest, with the Seven Dwarfs, they will be

nice back and give you a lantern.

Hint:

If you "clean" the Seven Dwarfs house, they will accidentally leave

behind a pouch of diamonds on the table.  However, you need

to try to "return" the forgotten pouch of diamonds to them

in their mine. If you do, they will let you keep the diamonds

PLUS give you a lantern.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!

 

Problem:

The troll keeps getting me!!  How can I avoid him?!



Hint:

First of all, you need a lantern (you get that from the Seven

Dwarfs).

Hint:

Not only do you need a lantern, but you need to save your game

OFTEN!  I recommend saving your game each time you safely

enter a new section of the troll cave.  If you do this, you

will eventually get through the cave unharmed.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!

Problem:

I keep falling down the chasm!!  How do I go across it?



Hint:

I hope you found the board at the entrance to the cave.

Hint:

You need the board to cross the chasm.  Put it across the chasm

and then VERY CAREFULLY walk over it.

Hint:

Save your game when you enter this room.  Experiment to see how

close you can get to the chasm without falling in.  Then,

"Put the board across the chasm."  CAREFULLY walk across it.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!



Problem:

Every time I enter the swamp I sink and die.  There MUST be a way to

cross it!

Hint:

Try "jumping" on the grass tufts.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!

I can't seem to get from the last grass tuft to the little swamp

island!



Hint:

You have something in your inventory that will help.

Hint:

The cobra likes a certain kind of music.

Hint:

The cobra likes flute music.

6 ... Lolotte's Castle



Problem:

Lolotte asks me to do things for her.  Should I do them?



Hint:

Yes, you should.

Hint:

You won't advance in the game unless you bring her the items she

asks for.

Hint:

Lolotte wants the unicorn, the hen that lays the golden eggs, and

Pandora's Box.  You need to bring them to her if you want to

advance in the game.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!

 

Problem:

I'm locked in a tower bedroom!  How can I escape?!



Hint:

Be patient.  Help will come along.

Hint:

Did you notice Edgar pushing something under the tower door...?

Hint:

Edgar will help you by pushing a rose under the door.  Get the

rose and "look" at it; you will notice a gold key attached to

it.  This key will unlock the tower door.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!

 

Problem:

I keep falling off the stairs!!



Hint:

You may want to slow down and move very carefully.

Hint:

It would be best to put Rosella in "slow mode" while trying to

negotiate these steps, or any other tricky areas.

Hint:

Save your game before attempting to climb the stairs.  Then,

choose "Speed" from the menu bar and set the speed to a

slower level.  It is best to have your character go slower

when attempting to negotiate tricky areas.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!

 

Problem:

When I get too close to the sleeping goons they wake up and get me!!



Hint:

Then don't get too close to the sleeping goons!

Hint:

Actually, some goons will automatically wake up when you get too

close to them, but others will only RANDOMLY wake up when you

near them.

Hint:

It is best to SAVE YOUR GAME at this point.  Those goons are

tricky little devils and you don't want to throw everything

away because you didn't anticipate being caught by one.

Hint:

SAVE YOUR GAME before attempting to get around the goons.  Then,

try to stay as far away from them as you can.  However,

there are a couple of goons that may wake up RANDOMLY when

you pass by them, anyway.  All you can do is keep trying.

Eventually, that darn goon will stay asleep and let you pass.

That's all the hints for this problem, thanks for participating!

 

Problem:

Where are my lost possessions?  I know they're around here someplace!



Hint:

Your lost possessions are in the castle's kitchen.

Hint:

Your possessions are in the castle's kitchen; but first, you need

to get past the goon!

Hint:

Your possessions are in the castle's kitchen.  However, SAVE YOUR

GAME before attempting to pass by the sleeping goon.  This

goon RANDOMLY wakes up, and he seems to wake up more often

than not.  Just keep trying.  Eventually, he will stay asleep

and let you pass.  WARNING - Once you get the possessions from

the kitchen, save your game again before venturing out into the

dining room.

Problem:

How do I go into the east hallway?  Every time I try, a goon gets me!



Hint:

You will NEVER be able to enter the east hallway until Lolotte is

disposed of.

Hint:

Once Lolotte is "taken care of" the goons will have much more

respect for you, and you will be able to wander the castle

at will.  But NOT before then!

Problem:

I found Lolotte!  Now, how do I get the talisman without waking her?



Hint:

Hopefully, you have your lost possessions with you....

Hint:

You SHOULD BE carrying something that will deal with Lolotte.

Hint:

Are you carrying something that "looks like" a weapon?

Hint:

Do you have Cupid's bow and arrow...?

Hint:

You should still have ONE golden arrow left (the first one you

used on the unicorn).  Shoot the arrow at Lolotte while she's

sleeping. Cupid's arrow will "do its trick" on Lolotte and

enable you to get the talisman.

Problem:

Where is Edgar?  I can't find him.



Hint:

Edgar is very shy.  He only shows up when he wants to show up.

Hint:

You can't FIND Edgar.  As he is very bashful, he will only show

up when he wants to.

Problem:

Is there anything to do in the cell?



Hint:

Actually, no.

nothing to do, or get, in the cell.

Problem:

What do I do in the storage room?



Hint:

Have you "looked" in the storage room?  Is there anything special

there?

Hint:

You should have noticed that the magic hen and Pandora's Box are

there.  Get them.

Problem:

I found the unicorn again!  Now, what do I do with it?



Hint:

Being a nice, honest girl...what would be a nice thing to

do...especially considering the circumstances?

Hint:

Free it!
