HOW TO LOAD DANGER IN DRINDISTI

Boot up your HELLFIRE WARRIOR disk following the loading instructions that came with your 
game. At the point where the computer asks you if you want to re-enter a saved level, 
answer "y". You will be asked to insert the disk with the saved level. At this time, 
insert DANGER IN DRINDISTI and press the "Return" key. Enter a level number between 6 and 
9 and hit the "Return" key. You are now ready to begin play.


NOTE: The order of difficulty for DANGER IN DRINDISTI is as follows: Level 7, Level 6, 
Level 9, Level 8. This sequence is necessary to take advantage of having no room numbers 
displayed on Levels 6 and 8 (a feature of the original Hell re Warrior program). We 
strongly suggest that you play the game in this order.
