Eamon is a role-playing adventure game created by Donald Brown, and
released for the Apple II in 1980. Brown encouraged players to modify
and add to Eamon, publishing technical information on the game, and
including a Game Designer program with Utilities to assist them.

Eamon is notable for being one of the first adventure games designed to
be modular, with expansion packs written by users forming an integral
part of the game experience. More than 270 individual Eamon adventures
have been written by various authors to work with the Eamon system.
