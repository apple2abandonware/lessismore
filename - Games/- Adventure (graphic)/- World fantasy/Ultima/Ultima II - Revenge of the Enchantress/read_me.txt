Ultima II - The Revenge of the Enchantress - Read Me
====================================================

Question: What was the last completed Apple II Ultima project?

Answer: The Ultima II rewrite.

   That answer may surprise some as few knew that there was an Ultima 
II rewrite.  However following the completion of Ultima V, in 1989 
Origin decided to release "Ultima Trilogy I.II.III" on most of their 
supported platforms including the Apple II.  This would contain the 
first three Ultimas with a newly rewritten player's manual and 
cardboard maps in a single box.

   For the Apple II version a problem arose with the original Ultima 
II.  The original game was released by Sierra Online in 1982 prior to 
the release of the Apple IIe and didn't support any of the new features 
available in that platform such as lower case and up and down arrow 
movement keys.  A similar problem in 1986 had resulted in a new game 
engine for the Ultima I re-release.  The decision was made to adapt 
Ultima II to this game engine for the Ultima Trilogy.

   Sadly the Ultima Trilogy I.II.III ended up being the final Apple II 
release made by Origin.  In 1990 Origin scraped plans for Ultima VI for 
the Apple II and abandoned the entire platform opting for the IBM PC as 
their primary developing environment.  

   For collectors, the Ultima II rewrite was never available outside of 
the Ultima Trilogy package.

Enjoy!
