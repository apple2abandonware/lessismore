[Back Of Box Text]

You're practically a secret weapon since you escaped torture in Castle 
Wolfenstein.(TM) Nobody gets post Nazi guards better than you. That's why 
your commanders have a favor to ask: deliver a "package" to the Fuehrer, 
The Underground has smuggled a bomb into o closet inside the Fuehrer's 
Berlin Bunker. Now it's up to you to move it to a secret conference room, 
set the timer... and escape. And that won't be easy. The bunker is 
crawling with elite stormtroopers. Any one of them will trip the alarm at 
the least suspicion of trouble. But you're not worried- You're ready for 
what ever it takes to win this war. You're ready to go Beyond Castle 
Wolfenstein.(TM)

INTRODUCTION

World War II is crippling Europe and the whole world has felt the impact 
of one man.

The underground resistance movement has arranged to sneak you into a 
secluded courtyard outside the Fuehrer's Berlin bunker with a gun, ten 
bullets, and at least one pass to show the guards. A confederate within 
the bunker has put a briefcase containing a bomb into a closet somewhere 
on the first floor.

Your mission:

Find the bomb, locate the Fuehrer's private conference room, and leave 
the bomb, timed to detonate! Then return to the courtyard from which you 
entered the bunker. Your underground liaison, Hans Undfusse, will meet 
you there and convey you to safety. Good luck!

STARTING THE GAME

LOADING THE PROGRAM AND SELECTING CONTROLS

The Apple version requires either an Apple II+ or Apple IIe computer with 
a memory capacity of 48K and DOS 3.3. Apple IIe users must keep the CAPS 
LOCK key down at all times.

Insert your program disk into the drive with the label facing up. Turn on 
the computer. When the title page appears, press RETURN to display the 
control selection page, or wait approximately 15 seconds for a game 
demonstration.

You may press K to select Keyboard controls, J to select Joystick 
controls or P to select Paddle controls. You may also adjust controls by 
pressing A and then the type of controls you want to adjust (K, J or P). 
Once you have chosen controls, the screen will display the OPTIONS PAGE.

OPTIONS PAGE

After you have selected your game controls, the screen will display the 
game options:

| A) START A NEW GAME WITH A NEW BUNKER     |
|    AND PRESERVE CURRENT GAME LEVEL.       |
|                                           |
| B) START A NEW GAME WITH A NEW BUNKER     |
|    AND SET GAME TO LEVEL ONE.             |
|                                           |
| C) START A NEW GAME WITH SAME BUNKER.     |
|                                           |
| PRESS RETURN TO BEGIN GAME                |
|                                           |
`-------------------------------------------'

Select the option you want by pressing A, B or C. When you select the 
option you want, a box will appear around your selection. Press RETURN to 
begin the game.

When you select option A, you will play the game at your present rank but 
with a new bunker. Option B allows you to reset your skill level and 
change the bunker. Option C allows you to play at the same skill level 
with the same bunker.


PLAYING THE GAME

You enter the bunker at ground level and proceed down to the third level, 
where the Fuehrer's conference room is located. You will always start in 
the same bunker until you accomplish your mission, or until you generate 
a new bunker. You will always start with a gun, at least one pass, and 
the maximum of ten bullets and 100 marks.

Each room in the bunker has at least one doorway that leads to an 
adjoining room, or an elevator that leads to another level of the bunker.

As you roam from room to room, trying to find the closet that contains 
the briefcase with the bomb and then the Fuehrer's conference room, you 
will have to show the proper pass to the guard when he demands to see it. 
If you show the wrong pass he will continue to demand that you show your 
pass. At this time you can either try again to guess which one he wants 
or you can bribe him with money. The guards seated at desks can be bribed 
also, - for information, which they'll give in cryptic phrases whose 
meaning you must decipher.

You can shoot the guards, but if any other guards see or hear you 
shooting your gun, they will trip the alarm to alert the whole bunker. If 
you kill a guard, you can drag the body away, out of the main 
thoroughfare, to conceal it from the other guards. If you have a dagger 
you can kill them silently. The guards will set off the alarms if they 
see a body, or if they are at all suspicious, and unless you can find a 
way to disable the alarm system, they will all come after you.

When you search a dead or surrendered guard and find some items that you 
need, they will automatically be transferred to your supply. However, 
bullets will be transferred only if the guard's clip contains more 
bullets than your clip.

Replenish your supply of bullets and acquire money, passes and other 
supplies by searching guards and opening supply closets. Some of the 
supply closets are locked, and you'll have to use the number keys on your 
keyboard to figure out the correct combination. Three single digit 
numbers pressed in sequence unlock the door. You'll hear the tumblers 
click for each number. If you press a wrong number, you must start the 
combination over. For example, suppose that the combination for a closet 
is 1-7-9. If you press 1, you will hear a click. If the next number you 
press is anything BUT a 7, you will not hear the click, and you must re-
enter the combination from the beginning (i.e., press 1 again). When you 
hear two clicks in sequence, you have the first two numbers of the 
combination. Repeat this trial-and-error process until you get all three 
numbers in sequence. The door will then unlock. You can get first aid 
kits from the closets. You'll find first aid kits useful when you get 
wounded.

After you find the bomb, you may have to reset the timer before you find 
the Fuehrer's conference room. To do this, first set the briefcase down 
(B), then reset the timer(R). Pick up the briefcase again, once the timer 
has been reset (B).

To show passes, press the corresponding number key when the guard 
requests it.

=====================================

           INSTRUCTIONS
           ------------

     NOW FINALLY FOR THE INSTRUCTIONS.
    WHEN YOU FIRST WALK INTO A ROOM
    A GUARD WILL ASK YOU FOR A PASS.
    YOU CAN EITHER ENTER A NUMBER
    FROM 1-5 OR BRIBE HIM BY USING
    THE "M" COMMAND. WE FOUND THAT
    THE BEST METHOD OF DISCOVERING
    WHICH PASS TO USE IS BY DOING
    THE FOLLOWING:  

      GIVE THE GUARD THE FIRST PASS,
    THEN IF HE DOES NOT ACCEPT IT
    HE WILL TAKE THE PASS AND ASK
    YOU FOR ANOTHER ONE. YOU SHOULD 
    THEN BRIBE HIM. GO ON TO THE NEXT
    ROOM REPEATING THE ABOVE STEPS 
    UNTIL YOU FIND THE CORRECT PASS.
    (NOTE: MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE
    ENOUGH MONEY TO BRIBE THEM WITH.)
    ALSO WHEN YOU GO INTO A ROOM MAKE
    SURE THAT YOUR GUN IS OUT OF SIGHT.
    
     TRAVEL THROUGH THE MAZE OF ROOMS
    BY EITHER USING THE MAP OR GOING
    THROUGH IT AT RANDOM PATTERN COL-
    LECTING THE DESIRED SUPPLIES NEEDED
    TO KILL HITLER. IF YOU COME UPON
    A LOCKED CLOSET YOU MAY EITHER
    SHOOT IT OPEN (A DANGEROUS METHOD)
    OR OPEN IT BY DOING THE FOLLOWING:

      EACH DOOR HAS A 3-DIGIT CODE.
    TO UNLOCK THE CLOSET YOU MUST ENTER
    THE PROPER CODE. THIS IS ACHIEVED
    BY RANDOMLY SELECTING THE FIRST 
    DIGIT (EX. 4). IF YOU HEAR A 
    "CLICK" YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS THE
    FIRST DIGIT OF THE CODE. YOU THEN
    GO ON TO THE NEXT DIGIT BY FIRST
    ENTERING THE CORRECT FIRST DIGIT
    AND THEN ENTERING A SECOND NUMBER.
    IF YOU DONT HEAR A CLICK TRY 
    THE PROCEDURE AGAIN BUT WITH A
    DIFFERENT DIGIT. YOU THEN DO THE
    SAME THING WITH THE THIRD AND 
    FINAL DIGIT.

     IN THESE LOCKED CLOSETS YOU MAY
    FIND A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS.
    FROM SECRET PASSAGES TO THE BOMB
    ITSELF (WHICH WILL BE LATER EX-
    PLAINED.)
    
     YOU MAY ALSO FIND A DAGGAR INSIDE
    ONE OF THE LOCKED CLOSETS. THE
    DAGGAR IS A VERY USEFULL WEAPON.
    IT ENABLES YOU TO KILL GUARDS 
    WITHOUT WASTING BULLETS. ALL YOU
    NEED TO DO IS WALK INTO A GUARD
    WHILE HIS BACK IS TURNED AND HE
    WILL INSTANTANEOSLY DIE. TO SWITCH
    WEAPONS FROM THE GUN TO THE DAGGAR
    OR VISA VERSA YOU TYPE A COLON.
  
     YOU MAY ALSO FIND A MEDICAL KIT
    INSIDE ONE OF THE LOCKED CLOSETS.
    THIS IS VERY USEFUL IN CASE YOU 
    ARE WOUNDED. TO USE THE MEDICAL KIT
    TYPE IN "F" AND THE COMPUTER WILL
    REPLY WITH "BANDAGING...".

     THERE ALSO CAN BE FOUND A TOOL
    KIT, BUT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THERE
    IS NO APPARANT USE FOR IT.

     ANOTHER FEATURE OF CASTLE WOLF-
    ENSTIEN ][ IS THAT THERE ARE SEAT-
    ED GUARDS IN VARIOUS ROOMS. THESE
    GUARDS WILL ALSO ASK YOU FOR A
    PASS, BUT IT IS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE 
   TO BRIBE HIM. BY DOING THIS, HE WILL
    GIVE YOU VALUABLE INFORMATION WHICH
   WILL COME IN HANDY IN LATER PARTS OF
    THE GAME. HE CAN GIVE YOU FOUR
    TYPES OF INFORMATION:

     A) HE TELLS YOU WHAT PASS TO USE
        ON THAT CURRENT LEVEL.

     B) HE GIVES YOU A COMBINATION
        WHICH MAY BE USED ON ONE OF
        THE CLOSETS.

     C) HE TELLS YOU THE CIRCUIT BREAK-
        ER NUMBER THAT IS USED TO TURN
        OF THE ALARM.
   
     D) HE GIVES YOU CERTAIN HINTS 
        ABOUT THE GAME.
     
     INSIDE A HEAVILY GUARDED ROOM,
    ABOUT 4 OR 5 GUARDS, THERE IS A
    CLOSET IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM
    WHICH CONTAINS A METAL BOX. ON THE
    BOX THERE IS A LOCKED PANEL AND THE
    CIRCUIT BREAKERS. USUALLY TO TURN
    OFF THE ALARM, YOU MUST ENTER THE 
    NUMBER OF THE CIRCUIT BREAKER. THIS
    ACTS AS A TOGGLE SWITCH WHICH WILL 
    TURN THE ALARM ON AND OFF.

              THE BOMB
              --------

     ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS
    OF THE GAME IS THE BOMB. YOU FIND
    IT IN A LOCKED CLOSET AND USE IT
    TO ASASINATE HITLER AND THE CABINET
    MEMBERS. WHEN YOU PICK UP THE BOMB
    A BUILT-IN TIMER AUTOMATICALLY 
    STARTS. IT STARTS AT 1002 AND WHEN
    IT REACHES 0 IT BLOWS UP. TO PRE-
    VENT THIS FROM HAPPENING PREMATURLY
    YOU MAY HAVE TO RESET IT PERIODIC-
   ALLY. THIS IS DONE BY FIRST DROPPING
    THE BOMB (TYPE "B") AND THE HITTING
    "R". YOU WILL THEN SEE THE MESSAGE
    "RESETING TIMER...". WHEN THIS IS 
    DONE YOU PICK UP THE BOMB (TYPE "B"
   AGAIN) AND THE TIMER WILL RESTART AT
   1002.(NOTE: MAKE SURE THAT NO GUARDS
    SEE YOU WHEN YOU PERFORM THIS PRE-
    CEDURE.) 

     TO KILL HITLER YOU MUST TAKE THE
    BOMB TO HIS CHAMBER, PLACE IT NEAR
    THE DOOR, AND RETURN BACK TO PLACE
    WHERE YOU STARTED FROM.
