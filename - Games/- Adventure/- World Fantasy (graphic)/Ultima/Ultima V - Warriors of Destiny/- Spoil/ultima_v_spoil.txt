     Ultima V has to be the most challenging game I have ever played, or will
probably play for quite some time.  My compliments go out to Richard Garret for
this excellent game.  There are a few dead giveaways in the game though.  For
example, I took notes of >EVERYTHING< everyone said (word for word).  I could
tell when someone was withholding information because I would only get about
2-4 lines out of them.  Now, If a person told me 1/2 to a page of text, I knew
I was done with him.  Ideas for the next one, right?
 
     Well, in order to solve U5, you must do the following:
          -Obtain all 3 shards from the underworld
         -Use the shards to destroy the Shadowlords
        -Retrieve the Scepter, Crown, Amulet, and Sandlewood Box
       -Become 8th level
      -Completed all of the shrines quests
     -Be 'Ordained' by Brittish when you sleep
    -Then enter the 'hole' to the center of the world, wind your way around
     (up and down levels, of course) and free Lord Brittish
 
Got it?  Didn't think so...  Here is a more in depth description of the above:
 
1) Obtain all 3 shards:
     These are found in 'obvious' places in the underworld.  I remembered to
write down only two of the coordinates, sorry I can't tell you the Third.
(C0,50) and (B0,B8) are the only two I know.  To obtain your coordinate hit
<ctrl>-2 (on a //gs) or <ctrl>-<shift>-2 (on a //e).  This will spit out a long
number.  The last 4 digits are your current coordinates.  Note: 0,0 is to your
upper-left (as if you were in the 4th quadrant of a plane).
 
2) Use the Shards:
     Go into each of the castles (Empath Abbey, Serpents Hold, and Lyceum) and
find the flames of Truth/Courage/Love.  You then must position yourself
directly below it.  Next summon the Shadowlord who is opposite that flame
(Truth summons Falsehood, Love summons Hatred, and Courage summons Cowardice). 
To do this shout out their names (Falsehood: Faulinei, Hatred: Astaroth,
Cowardice: Nosfentor).  THe shadowlord should appear directly above the flame,
pass a turn so that it walks onto the flame, then use the correct shard.  It
will give you this little song and dance then say ...doom has been wrought! 
And the shadowlord is gone forever!
 
3) Retrieve Lord Brittish's articles:
     The scepter is in Stonegate (94,4A) or is the reverse? well it is either
(94,4A or 4A,94 I'm looking off of my maps and forgot which way is which). 
Well, you go in there and grab it.  NOTE: you MUST have the flying carpet by
now to get over the traps or you will instantly die upon touching the traps
(nice, huh?).  The Crown is on the top level of Blackthorns castle (behind the
magically locked door).  THe Amulet is in the underworld (lower left part of
the world approximately 70,D0 give or take a dozen) and finally the sandlewood
box is on the top level of Lord Brittish's castle (again behind magically
locked doors).  To get it you must play the following tune on the harpsichord
(678-987-8767653) and that will cause a section of the wall to disappear so you
can grab the box.
 
4) Level 8
     Well, this is quite obvious.  You need at least 6,400 experience to do
this...Takes quite some time.
 
5) Quests
     You must go to each shrine, it will give you a quest to go to the codex
(E9,E9) where it will tell you some pretty important info.  The last time you
go there (the eigth time) you will get some other info.  This is the
translation:
 
Beyond shades egress in the centre of the underworld there is a place of
darkness.  Beyond this darkness lies the gate to the core of the world.  When
thou art ready thou must call forth Veramocor to unlock the gate and venture
past ethereal words and stealers of souls.  That which the world hath, dost
awaits thy coming!
 
6) Once you have completed steps 1-5 (not necessarily in that order) Lord
Brittish will come to you while you sleep and say something like:  Thou art now
armed and thy must now complete thy destiny! You are then off to #7!
 
7) Enter the hole (80,80 in the underworld) and get down to 8th level. 
Somewhere on the 8th level is a room which looks like a room in a town.  You
must go stand before the mirror.  It will suck you in and your done!
 
Here is some other important info:
 
Virture/Mantra/Word of Power chart:(probably the most important chart there is)
 
Virtue         Mantra         Word of Power     Dungeons
Honesty        Ahm            Fallax            Deceit
Compassion     Mu             Vilis             Despise
Valor          Ra             Inopia            Destard
Justice        Beh            Malum             Wrong
Sacrifice      Cah            Avidus            (unknown)
Honor          Summ           Infama            Shame
Spirituality   Om             Ignavus           (unknown)
Humility       Lumm           Veramocor         (unknown)
 
Mystical weapons/armor are at (e9,e9) in the underworld
 
The runes can be found in any ordinary encylopedia (to help you translate the
encrypted text).
