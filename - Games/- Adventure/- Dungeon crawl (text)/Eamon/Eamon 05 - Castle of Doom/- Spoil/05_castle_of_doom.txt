CASTLE OF DOOM Author: Donald Brown

Castle of Doom is the third adventure written by Donald Brown for Eamon.
While Doom retains the slightly absurdist and irreverent mood of The
Beginners Cave and Lair of the Minotaur, employing, e.g., three dwarves
named "Huey," "Dewey," and "Louie", Brown also increases the complexity
of the programming. Doom has a "snapshot" feature that the disk records
the state of the dungeon upon a player's exit so that he or she may
return to the Main Hall without interrupting the adventure.


Premise

Castle of Doom lacks a detailed plot; the premise of the adventure is
that "two kindly old ladies" maintain the circular Castle of Doom as a
challenge to members of the Guild of Free Adventurers. The player is
expected to explore and plunder the titular castle. The tongue-in-cheek
suggestion of some inherent artificiality in the world of Eamon is in
character for Donald Brown's adventures, cf. The Beginner's Cave, in
which a character called The Warlord is tasked with keeping the cave
stocked with treasure, rats, and pirates.
