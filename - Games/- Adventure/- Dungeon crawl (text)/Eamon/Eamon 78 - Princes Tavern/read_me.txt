THE PRINCE'S TAVERN - Eamon Adventure #78

While traveling in another kingdom, the adventurer is captured by King Radaar
and sent to the Prince's Tavern in search of a rare bottle of 600-year-old
Scotch.

The tavern is a notorious den of strange alcohol, strange people, and even
stranger magic. The adventurer must find his or her way through the mayhem, with
the help of an old friend from the Main Hall.

This adventure is notable for its many creative special effects, including a
drinking contest and numerous whimsical, creative, and dangerous traps. A couple
new spells add to the plot, including a LOCATE spell that helps you find items
and people, once you manage to learn it. The storytelling is vivid and
interesting throughout.
