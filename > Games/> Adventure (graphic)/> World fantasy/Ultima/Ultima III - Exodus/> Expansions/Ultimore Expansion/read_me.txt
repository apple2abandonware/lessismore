Ultimore

Ultimore are a series of unofficial expansion packs created for Ultima III on the Apple II
by Joel Fenton of Backstreet Software between 1984/1985.

The scenarios were created by reverse engineering the file formats of Ultima III, and 
producing an alternative disk for side two which included new data for towns and dungeons. 
Because the program files remain unchanged, the quest of the original Ultima III, to 
collect the four cards and marks and ultimately defeat a final boss, remains unchanged.
A total of 5 alternative scenarios were released, including: A Divided World, Pirate 
World, Spaceship Crash, Egypt, and Rule Of The Slave Lords. These setting were advertised 
via software magazine ads and sold directly to consumers for $20. Little is known about 
these alternative settings except for the first, A Divided World.

In A Divided World, the evil legacy of Exodus has been revived by Maxman, a Priest of the 
Snake described as a "shape-shifting balron". Maxman has built a castle stronghold and 
erected a force field between the northern and southern hemispheres, as civil war looms 
between the two lands. Maxman attempts to wrest the throne from the rightful heir to the 
land, Viceroy Faerdin.
The player visits multiple new locations including Darya: City of Heat and Steam, Amu, the 
Monastery of St. Elmo, and Wrigley Field where adventurers can watch the Cubs play the 
Giants.
