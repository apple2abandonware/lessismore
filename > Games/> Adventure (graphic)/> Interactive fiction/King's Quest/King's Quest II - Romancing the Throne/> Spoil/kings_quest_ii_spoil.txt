      This solution to the Kings Quest II game was developed by the
      joint efforts of: Alan Ford, Brian Mann, Doug Gilliat, Paul Rodi,
      Nancy Pierce, and Tom Harding.  If you just stick to this and
      don't explore, you will miss a lot of good entertainment in the
      game.
 
      Tremendous thanks to those on Compuserve, The Assassins Palace,
      The Domain, and The Blue Ridge Express who gave us help with
      the tough spots.
