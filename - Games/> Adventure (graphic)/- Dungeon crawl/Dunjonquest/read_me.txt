All Dunjonquest titles were advertised as "real time" RPGs, but actually
use a hybrid between a real time and turn-based system. Monsters move
and take turns on their own periodic timetable, whose pace can be chosen
from three options at the start of the game. Even if the player remains
idle, the monsters keep advancing and attacking.

Dunjonquest introduced the concept of having room descriptions presented
as detailed text printed in the game's manuals, similar to role-playing
solitaire adventures. Each room in Temple of Apshai has a room number
attached to it, displayed in the UI. By checking the corresponding room
number listed in the "Chambers of the Dunjon" section in the manual, the
player can get detailed descriptions of the atmosphere and objects in
the rooms, like dust on the floor, particular smells in the air or
peculiarities of the architecture. The descriptions warrant guesses at
traps, treasures, hidden passages and lurking enemies within the room.
The printed room descriptions were used as a means of overcoming the
limitations of the simple black-on-white graphics and limited memory for
displaying text on screen. They also serve as an early form of copyright
protection. Only the later titles in the series feature room
descriptions.
